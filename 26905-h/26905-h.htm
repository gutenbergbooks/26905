<p>NOTE</p>
</div>

<p>The tales in this book belong to two different epochs
in the life of the Far West. The first five are reminiscent
of &#8220;border days and deeds&#8221;&mdash;of days before the great
railway was built which changed a waste into a fertile
field of civilization. The remaining stories cover the
period passed since the Royal Northwest Mounted Police
and the Pullman Car first startled the early pioneer,
and sent him into the land of the farther North or drew
him into the quiet circle of civic routine and humdrum
occupation.</p>

<h2>A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hai-yai, so bright a day, so clear!&#8221; said Mitiahwe
as she entered the big lodge and laid upon a wide, low
couch, covered with soft skins, the fur of a grizzly which
had fallen to her man&#8217;s rifle. &#8220;<i>Hai-yai</i>, I wish it would
last forever&mdash;so sweet!&#8221; she added, smoothing the fur
lingeringly and showing her teeth in a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will come a great storm, Mitiahwe. See, the
birds go south so soon,&#8221; responded a deep voice from a
corner by the doorway.</p>
<p>The young Indian wife turned quickly, and, in a defiant,
fantastic mood&mdash;or was it the inward cry against
an impending fate, the tragic future of those who will
not see, because to see is to suffer?&mdash;she made some
quaint, odd motions of the body which belonged to a
mysterious dance of her tribe, and, with flashing eyes,
challenged the comely old woman seated on a pile of
deer-skins.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is morning, and the day will last forever,&#8221; she
said, nonchalantly, but her eyes suddenly took on a
far-away look, half apprehensive, half wondering. The
birds were indeed going south very soon, yet had there
ever been so exquisite an autumn as this, had her man
ever had so wonderful a trade, her man with the brown
hair, blue eyes, and fair, strong face?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The birds go south, but the hunters and buffalo still
go north,&#8221; Mitiahwe urged, searchingly, looking hard at
her mother&mdash;Oanita, the Swift Wing.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dream said that the winter will be dark and
lonely, that the ice will be thick, the snow deep, and
that many hearts will be sick because of the black days
and the hunger that sickens the heart,&#8221; answered Swift
Wing.</p>
<p>Mitiahwe looked into Swift Wing&#8217;s dark eyes, and an
anger came upon her. &#8220;The hearts of cowards will
freeze,&#8221; she rejoined, &#8220;and to those that will not see
the sun the world will be dark,&#8221; she added. Then suddenly
she remembered to whom she was speaking, and
a flood of feeling ran through her; for Swift Wing had
cherished her like a fledgling in the nest till her young
white man came from &#8220;down East.&#8221; Her heart had
leaped up at sight of him, and she had turned to him
from all the young men of her tribe, waiting in a kind
of mist till he, at last, had spoken to her mother, and
then one evening, her shawl over her head, she had come
along to his lodge.</p>
<p>A thousand times as the four years passed by she
had thought how good it was that she had become his
wife&mdash;the young white man&#8217;s wife, rather than the wife
of Breaking Rock, son of White Buffalo, the chief, who
had four hundred horses and a face that would have
made winter and sour days for her. Now and then
Breaking Rock came and stood before the lodge, a distance
off, and stayed there hour after hour, and once or
twice he came when her man was with her; but nothing
could be done, for earth and air and space were common
to them all, and there was no offence in Breaking Rock
gazing at the lodge where Mitiahwe lived. Yet it seemed
as though Breaking Rock was waiting&mdash;waiting and
hoping. That was the impression made upon all who
saw him, and even old White Buffalo, the chief, shook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
his head gloomily when he saw Breaking Rock, his son,
staring at the big lodge which was so full of happiness,
and so full also of many luxuries never before seen at
a trading-post on the Koonee River. The father of
Mitiahwe had been chief, but because his three sons had
been killed in battle the chieftainship had come to White
Buffalo, who was of the same blood and family. There
were those who said that Mitiahwe should have been
chieftainess; but neither she nor her mother would ever
listen to this, and so White Buffalo and the tribe loved
Mitiahwe because of her modesty and goodness. She
was even more to White Buffalo than Breaking Rock,
and he had been glad that Dingan the white man&mdash;Long
Hand he was called&mdash;had taken Mitiahwe for his woman.
Yet behind this gladness of White Buffalo, and that
of Swift Wing, and behind the silent watchfulness of
Breaking Rock, there was a thought which must ever
come when a white man mates with an Indian maid,
without priest or preacher, or writing, or book, or bond.</p>
<p>Yet four years had gone; and all the tribe, and all
who came and went, half-breeds, traders, and other
tribes, remarked how happy was the white man with
his Indian wife. They never saw anything but light
in the eyes of Mitiahwe, nor did the old women of the
tribe who scanned her face as she came and went, and
watched and waited too for what never came&mdash;not even
after four years.</p>
<p>Mitiahwe had been so happy that she had not really
missed what never came; though the desire to have
something in her arms which was part of them both had
flushed up in her veins at times, and made her restless
till her man had come home again. Then she had forgotten
the unseen for the seen, and was happy that they
two were alone together&mdash;that was the joy of it all, so
much alone together; for Swift Wing did not live with
them, and, like Breaking Rock, she watched her daughter&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
life, standing afar off, since it was the unwritten law
of the tribe that the wife&#8217;s mother must not cross the
path or enter the home of her daughter&#8217;s husband. But
at last Dingan had broken through this custom, and insisted
that Swift Wing should be with her daughter when
he was away from home, as now on this wonderful autumn
morning, when Mitiahwe had been singing to the
Sun, to which she prayed for her man and for everlasting
days with him.</p>
<p>She had spoken angrily but now, because her soul
sharply resented the challenge to her happiness which
her mother had been making. It was her own eyes
that refused to see the cloud which the sage and bereaved
woman had seen and conveyed in images and
figures of speech natural to the Indian mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Hai-yai</i>,&#8221; she said now, with a strange, touching sigh
breathing in the words, &#8220;you are right, my mother, and
a dream is a dream; also, if it be dreamed three times,
then is it to be followed, and it is true. You have lived
long, and your dreams are of the Sun and the Spirit.&#8221;
She shook a little as she laid her hand on a buckskin coat
of her man hanging by the lodge door; then she steadied
herself again, and gazed earnestly into her mother&#8217;s
eyes. &#8220;Have all your dreams come true, my mother?&#8221;
she asked, with a hungering heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was the dream that came out of the dark
five times, when your father went against the Crees, and
was wounded, and crawled away into the hills, and all
our warriors fled&mdash;they were but a handful, and the
Crees like a young forest in number! I went with my
dream, and found him after many days, and it was
after that you were born, my youngest and my last.
There was also&#8221;&mdash;her eyes almost closed, and the needle
and thread she held lay still in her lap&mdash;&#8220;when two of
your brothers were killed in the drive of the buffalo.
Did I not see it all in my dream, and follow after them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
to take them to my heart? And when your sister was
carried off, was it not my dream which saw the trail, so
that we brought her back again to die in peace, her eyes
seeing the Lodge whither she was going, open to her,
and the Sun, the Father, giving her light and promise&mdash;for
she had wounded herself to die that the thief who
stole her should leave her to herself! Behold, my
daughter, these dreams have I had, and others; and I
have lived long and have seen the bright day break into
storm, and the herds flee into the far hills where none
could follow, and hunger come, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Hai-yo</i>, see, the birds flying south,&#8221; said the girl,
with a gesture toward the cloudless sky. &#8220;Never since
I lived have they gone south so soon.&#8221; Again she
shuddered slightly, then she spoke slowly: &#8220;I also have
dreamed, and I will follow my dream. I dreamed&#8221;&mdash;she
knelt down beside her mother and rested her hands
in her mother&#8217;s lap&mdash;&#8220;I dreamed that there was a wall
of hills dark and heavy and far away, and that whenever
my eyes looked at them they burned with tears; and
yet I looked and looked, till my heart was like lead in
my breast; and I turned from them to the rivers and
the plains that I loved. But a voice kept calling to me,
&#8216;Come, come! Beyond the hills is a happy land. The
trail is hard, and your feet will bleed, but beyond is the
happy land.&#8217; And I would not go for the voice that
spoke, and at last there came an old man in my dream
and spoke to me kindly, and said, &#8216;Come with me, and
I will show thee the way over the hills to the Lodge
where thou shalt find what thou hast lost!&#8217; And I said
to him, &#8216;I have lost nothing&#8217;; and I would not go.
Twice I dreamed this dream, and twice the old man
came, and three times I dreamed it; and then I spoke
angrily to him, as but now I did to thee; and behold he
changed before my eyes, and I saw that he was now become&mdash;&#8221;
She stopped short, and buried her face in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
hands for a moment, then recovered herself. &#8220;Breaking
Rock it was I saw before me, and I cried out and fled.
Then I waked with a cry, but my man was beside me,
and his arm was round my neck; and this dream, is it
not a foolish dream, my mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman sat silent, clasping the hands of her
daughter firmly, and looking out of the wide doorway
toward the trees that fringed the river; and presently,
as she looked, her face changed and grew pinched all
at once, and Mitiahwe, looking at her, turned a startled
face toward the river also.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breaking Rock!&#8221; she said, in alarm, and got to her
feet quickly.</p>
<p>Breaking Rock stood for a moment looking toward
the lodge, then came slowly forward to them. Never
in all the four years had he approached this lodge of
Mitiahwe, who, the daughter of a chief, should have
married himself, the son of a chief! Slowly, but with
long, slouching stride, Breaking Rock came nearer. The
two women watched him without speaking. Instinctively
they knew that he brought news, that something
had happened; yet Mitiahwe felt at her belt for what
no Indian girl would be without; and this one was a
gift from her man on the anniversary of the day she
first came to his lodge.</p>
<p>Breaking Rock was at the door now, his beady eyes
fixed on Mitiahwe&#8217;s, his figure jerked to its full height,
which made him, even then, two inches less than Long
Hand. He spoke in a loud voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;The last boat this year goes down the river to-morrow.
Long Hand, your man, is going to his people.
He will not come back. He has had enough of the
Blackfoot woman. You will see him no more.&#8221; He
waved a hand to the sky. &#8220;The birds are going south.
A hard winter is coming quick. You will be alone.
Breaking Rock is rich. He has five hundred horses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
Your man is going to his own people. Let him go.
He is no man. It is four years, and still there are but
two in your lodge. How!&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung on his heel with a chuckle in his throat, for
he thought he had said a good thing, and that in truth
he was worth twenty white men. His quick ear caught
a movement behind him, however, and he saw the girl
spring from the lodge-door, something flashing from her
belt. But now the mother&#8217;s arms were round her, with
cries of protest, and Breaking Rock, with another laugh,
slipped away softly toward the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is good,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;She will kill him, perhaps,
when she goes to him. She will go, but he will not
stay. I have heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he disappeared among the trees, Mitiahwe disengaged
herself from her mother&#8217;s arms, went slowly
back into the lodge, and sat down on the great couch
where for so many moons she had lain with her man
beside her.</p>
<p>Her mother watched her closely, though she moved
about doing little things. She was trying to think what
she would have done if such a thing had happened to
her, if her man had been going to leave her. She assumed
that Dingan would leave Mitiahwe, for he would
hear the voices of his people calling far away, even as
the red man who went East into the great cities heard
the prairies and the mountains and the rivers and his
own people calling, and came back, and put off the
clothes of civilization, and donned his buckskins again,
and sat in the Medicine Man&#8217;s tent, and heard the spirits
speak to him through the mist and smoke of the sacred
fire. When Swift Wing first gave her daughter to the
white man she foresaw the danger now at hand, but this
was the tribute of the lower race to the higher, and&mdash;who
could tell? White men had left their Indian wives,
but had come back again, and forever renounced the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
life of their own nations, and become great chiefs, teaching
useful things to their adopted people, bringing up
their children as tribesmen&mdash;bringing up their children!
There it was, the thing which called them back, the
bright-eyed children, with the color of the brown prairie
in their faces, and their brains so sharp and strong. But
here was no child to call Dingan back, only the eloquent,
brave, sweet face of Mitiahwe..... If he went! Would
he go? Was he going? And now that Mitiahwe had
been told that he would go, what would she do? In her
belt was&mdash;but, no, that would be worse than all, and
she would lose Mitiahwe, her last child, as she had lost
so many others. What would she herself do if she were
in Mitiahwe&#8217;s place? Ah, she would make him stay
somehow&mdash;by truth or by falsehood; by the whispered
story in the long night; by her head upon his knee before
the lodge-fire, and her eyes fixed on his, luring him,
as the dream lures the dreamer into the far trail, to
find the Sun&#8217;s hunting-ground, where the plains are
filled with the deer and the buffalo and the wild horse;
by the smell of the cooking-pot and the favorite spiced
drink in the morning; by the child that ran to him with
his bow and arrows and the cry of the hunter&mdash;but there
was no child; she had forgotten. She was always recalling
her own happy early life with her man, and the clean-faced
papooses that crowded round his knee&mdash;one wife
and many children, and the old Harvester of the Years
reaping them so fast, till the children stood up as tall
as their father and chief. That was long ago, and she
had had her share&mdash;twenty-five years of happiness; but
Mitiahwe had had only four. She looked at Mitiahwe,
standing still for a moment like one rapt, then suddenly
she gave a little cry. Something had come into her
mind, some solution of the problem, and she ran and
stooped over the girl and put both hands on her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mitiahwe, heart&#8217;s blood of mine,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
birds go south, but they return. What matter if they
go so soon, if they return soon. If the Sun wills that
the winter be dark, and he sends the Coldmaker to close
the rivers and drive the wild ones far from the arrow
and the gun, yet he may be sorry, and send a second
summer&mdash;has it not been so, and the Coldmaker has
hurried away&mdash;away! The birds go south, but they
will return, Mitiahwe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard a cry in the night while my man slept,&#8221;
Mitiahwe answered, looking straight before her, &#8220;and
it was like the cry of a bird&mdash;calling, calling, calling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he did not hear&mdash;he was asleep beside Mitiahwe.
If he did not wake, surely it was good-luck. Thy breath
upon his face kept him sleeping. Surely it was good-luck
to Mitiahwe that he did not hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was smiling a little now, for she had thought of a
thing which would, perhaps, keep the man here in this
lodge in the wilderness; but the time to speak of it was
not yet. She must wait and see.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mitiahwe got to her feet with a spring, and
a light in her eyes. &#8220;<i>Hai-yai!</i>&#8221; she said with plaintive
smiling, ran to a corner of the lodge, and from a leather
bag drew forth a horseshoe and looked at it, murmuring
to herself.</p>
<p>The old woman gazed at her wonderingly. &#8220;What is
it, Mitiahwe?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is good-luck. So my man has said. It is the
way of his people. It is put over the door, and if a
dream come it is a good dream; and if a bad thing
come, it will not enter; and if the heart prays for a
thing hid from all the world, then it brings good-luck.
<i>Hai-yai!</i> I will put it over the door, and then&mdash;&#8221; All
at once her hand dropped to her side, as though some
terrible thought had come to her, and, sinking to the
floor, she rocked her body backward and forward for a
time, sobbing. But presently she got to her feet again,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
and, going to the door of the lodge, fastened the horseshoe
above it with a great needle and a string of buckskin.</p>
<p>&#8220;O great Sun,&#8221; she prayed, &#8220;have pity on me and
save me. I cannot live alone. I am only a Blackfoot
wife; I am not blood of his blood. Give, O great One,
blood of his blood, bone of his bone, soul of his soul,
that he will say, &#8216;This is mine, body of my body,&#8217; and
he will hear the cry and will stay. O great Sun, pity
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman&#8217;s heart beat faster as she listened.
The same thought was in the mind of both. If there
were but a child, bone of his bone, then perhaps he
would not go; or, if he went, then surely he would return
when he heard his papoose calling in the lodge in
the wilderness.</p>
<p>As Mitiahwe turned to her, a strange burning light in
her eyes, Swift Wing said: &#8220;It is good. The white man&#8217;s
Medicine for a white man&#8217;s wife. But if there were the
red man&#8217;s Medicine too&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the red man&#8217;s Medicine?&#8221; asked the young
wife, as she smoothed her hair, put a string of bright
beads around her neck, and wound a red sash round her
waist.</p>
<p>The old woman shook her head, a curious, half-mystic
light in her eyes, her body drawn up to its full height,
as though waiting for something. &#8220;It is an old Medicine.
It is of winters ago as many as the hairs of the
head. I have forgotten almost, but it was a great
Medicine when there were no white men in the land.
And so it was that to every woman&#8217;s breast there hung
a papoose, and every woman had her man, and the red
men were like leaves in the forest&mdash;but it was a winter
of winters ago, and the Medicine Men have forgotten;
and thou hast no child! When Long Hand comes, what
will Mitiahwe say to him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>Mitiahwe&#8217;s eyes were determined, her face was set,
she flushed deeply, then the color fled. &#8220;What my
mother would say, I will say. Shall the white man&#8217;s
Medicine fail? If I wish it, then it will be so; and I
will say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if the white man&#8217;s Medicine fail?&#8221; Swift Wing
made a gesture toward the door where the horseshoe
hung. &#8220;It is Medicine for a white man, will it be Medicine
for an Indian?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I not a white man&#8217;s wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if there were the Sun Medicine also, the Medicine
of the days long ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me. If you remember&mdash;<i>Kai!</i> but you do remember&mdash;I
see it in your face. Tell me, and I will
make that Medicine also, my mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow, if I remember it&mdash;I will think, and if I
remember it, to-morrow I will tell you, my heart&#8217;s blood.
Maybe my dream will come to me and tell me. Then,
even after all these years a papoose&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the boat will go at dawn to-morrow, and if he
go also&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mitiahwe is young, her body is warm, her eyes are
bright, the songs she sings, her tongue&mdash;if these keep
him not, and the Voice calls him still to go, then still
Mitiahwe shall whisper, and tell him&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Hai-yo</i>&mdash;hush,&#8221; said the girl, and trembled a little,
and put both hands on her mother&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>For a moment she stood so, then with an exclamation
suddenly turned and ran through the doorway, and
sped toward the river, and into the path which would
take her to the post, where her man traded with the
Indians and had made much money during the past six
years, so that he could have had a thousand horses and
ten lodges like that she had just left. The distance between
the lodge and the post was no more than a mile,
but Mitiahwe made a détour, and approached it from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
behind, where she could not be seen. Darkness was
gathering now, and she could see the glimmer of the light
of lamps through the windows, and as the doors opened
and shut. No one had seen her approach, and she stole
through a door which was open at the rear of the warehousing
room, and went quickly to another door leading
into the shop. There was a crack through which she
could see, and she could hear all that was said. As she
came she had seen Indians gliding through the woods
with their purchases, and now the shop was clearing
fast, in response to the urging of Dingan and his partner,
a Scotch half-breed. It was evident that Dingan was at
once abstracted and excited.</p>
<p>Presently only two visitors were left&mdash;a French half-breed
called Lablache, a swaggering, vicious fellow, and
the captain of the steamer <i>Ste. Anne</i>, which was to
make its last trip south in the morning&mdash;even now it
would have to break its way through the young ice.</p>
<p>Dingan&#8217;s partner dropped a bar across the door of the
shop, and the four men gathered about the fire. For a
time no one spoke. At last the captain of the <i>Ste. Anne</i>
said: &#8220;It&#8217;s a great chance, Dingan. You&#8217;ll be in civilization
again, and in a rising town of white people&mdash;Groise&#8217;ll
be a city in five years, and you can grow up
and grow rich with the place. The Company asked
me to lay it all before you, and Lablache here will buy
out your share of the business, at whatever your partner
and you prove it&#8217;s worth. You&#8217;re young; you&#8217;ve got
everything before you. You&#8217;ve made a name out here
for being the best trader west of the Great Lakes, and
now&#8217;s your time. It&#8217;s none of my affair, of course, but
I like to carry through what I&#8217;m set to do, and the
Company said, &#8216;You bring Dingan back with you. The
place is waiting for him, and it can&#8217;t wait longer than
the last boat down.&#8217; You&#8217;re ready to step in when he
steps out, ain&#8217;t you, Lablache?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>Lablache shook back his long hair, and rolled about
in his pride. &#8220;I give him cash for his share to-night&mdash;some
one is behin&#8217; me, <i>sacré</i>, yes! It is worth so much,
I pay and step in&mdash;I take the place over. I take half
the business here, and I work with Dingan&#8217;s partner. I
take your horses, Dingan, I take your lodge, I take all
in your lodge&mdash;<i>everyt&#8217;ing</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes glistened, and a red spot came to each cheek
as he leaned forward. At his last word Dingan, who
had been standing abstractedly listening as it were,
swung round on him with a muttered oath, and the skin
of his face appeared to tighten. Watching through the
crack of the door, Mitiahwe saw the look she knew well,
though it had never been turned on her, and her heart
beat faster. It was a look that came into Dingan&#8217;s face
whenever Breaking Rock crossed his path, or when one
or two other names were mentioned in his presence, for
they were names of men who had spoken of Mitiahwe
lightly, and had attempted to be jocular about her.</p>
<p>As Mitiahwe looked at him, now unknown to himself,
she was conscious of what that last word of Lablache&#8217;s
meant. <i>Everyt&#8217;ing</i> meant herself. Lablache&mdash;who had
neither the good qualities of the white man nor the
Indian, but who had the brains of the one and the
subtlety of the other, and whose only virtue was that he
was a successful trader, though he looked like a mere
woodsman, with rings in his ears, gayly decorated
buckskin coat and moccasins, and a furtive smile always
on his lips! <i>Everyt&#8217;ing!</i> Her blood ran cold at the
thought of dropping the lodge-curtain upon this man
and herself alone. For no other man than Dingan had
her blood run faster, and he had made her life blossom.
She had seen in many a half-breed&#8217;s and in many an
Indian&#8217;s face the look which was now in that of Lablache,
and her fingers gripped softly the thing in her
belt that had flashed out on Breaking Rock such a short
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
while ago. As she looked, it seemed for a moment as
though Dingan would open the door and throw Lablache
out, for in quick reflection his eyes ran from the man to
the wooden bar across the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll talk of the shop, and the shop only, Lablache,&#8221;
he said, grimly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not huckstering my home, and
I&#8217;d choose the buyer if I was selling. My lodge ain&#8217;t to
be bought, nor <i>anything</i> in it&mdash;not even the broom to
keep it clean of any half-breeds that&#8217;d enter it without
leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was malice in the words, but there was greater
malice in the tone, and Lablache, who was bent on
getting the business, swallowed his ugly wrath, and
determined that, if he got the business, he would get the
lodge also in due time; for Dingan, if he went, would
not take the lodge&mdash;or the woman&mdash;with him; and Dingan
was not fool enough to stay when he could go to
Groise to a sure fortune.</p>
<p>The captain of the <i>Ste. Anne</i> again spoke. &#8220;There&#8217;s
another thing the Company said, Dingan. You needn&#8217;t
go to Groise, not at once. You can take a month and
visit your folks down East, and lay in a stock of home-feelings
before you settle down at Groise for good.
They was fair when I put it to them that you&#8217;d mebbe
want to do that. &#8216;You tell Dingan,&#8217; they said, &#8216;that he
can have the month glad and grateful, and a free ticket
on the railway back and forth. He can have it at once,&#8217;
they said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watching, Mitiahwe could see her man&#8217;s face brighten,
and take on a look of longing at this suggestion; and it
seemed to her that the bird she heard in the night was
calling in his ears now. Her eyes went blind for a
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The game is with you, Dingan. All the cards are
in your hands; you&#8217;ll never get such another chance
again; and you&#8217;re only thirty,&#8221; said the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish they&#8217;d ask me,&#8221; said Dingan&#8217;s partner, with a
sigh, as he looked at Lablache. &#8220;I want my chance
bad, though we&#8217;ve done well here&mdash;good gosh, yes, all
through Dingan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The winters, they go queeck in Groise,&#8221; said Lablache.
&#8220;It is life all the time, trade all the time, plenty
to do and see&mdash;and a <i>bon fortune</i> to make, bagosh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your old home was in Nova Scotia, wasn&#8217;t it, Dingan?&#8221;
asked the captain, in a low voice. &#8220;I kem from
Connecticut, and I was East to my village las&#8217; year. It
was good, seein&#8217; all my old friends again; but I kem
back content, I kem back full of home-feelin&#8217;s and content.
You&#8217;ll like the trip, Dingan. It&#8217;ll do you good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dingan drew himself up with a start. &#8220;All right. I
guess I&#8217;ll do it. Let&#8217;s figure up again,&#8221; he said to his
partner, with a reckless air.</p>
<p>With a smothered cry Mitiahwe turned and fled into
the darkness, and back to the lodge. The lodge was
empty. She threw herself upon the great couch in an
agony of despair.</p>
<p>A half-hour went by. Then she rose, and began to
prepare supper. Her face was aflame, her manner was
determined, and once or twice her hand went to her
belt, as though to assure herself of something.</p>
<p>Never had the lodge looked so bright and cheerful;
never had she prepared so appetizing a supper; never
had the great couch seemed so soft and rich with furs,
so homelike and so inviting after a long day&#8217;s work.
Never had Mitiahwe seemed so good to look at, so graceful
and alert and refined&mdash;suffering does its work even
in the wild woods, with &#8220;wild people.&#8221; Never had the
lodge such an air of welcome and peace and home as
to-night; and so Dingan thought as he drew aside the
wide curtains of deerskin and entered.</p>
<p>Mitiahwe was bending over the fire, and appeared not
to hear him. &#8220;Mitiahwe,&#8221; he said, gently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
She was singing to herself, to an Indian air, the words
of a song Dingan had taught her:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Open the door: cold is the night, and my feet are heavy,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Heap up the fire, scatter upon it the cones and the scented</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.367917586460633em;'>leaves;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Spread the soft robe on the couch for the chief that</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Bring forth the cup of remembrance&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>It was like a low recitative, and it had a plaintive
cadence, as of a dove that mourned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mitiahwe,&#8221; he said, in a louder voice, but with a
break in it, too; for it all rushed upon him, all that she
had been to him&mdash;all that had made the great West
glow with life, made the air sweeter, the grass greener,
the trees more companionable and human: who it was
that had given the waste places a voice. Yet&mdash;yet,
there were his own people in the East, there was another
life waiting for him, there was the life of ambition and
wealth, and, and home&mdash;and children.</p>
<p>His eyes were misty as she turned to him with a
little cry of surprise, how much natural and how much
assumed&mdash;for she had heard him enter&mdash;it would have
been hard to say. She was a woman, and therefore the
daughter of pretence even when most real. He caught
her by both arms as she shyly but eagerly came to him.
&#8220;Good girl, good little girl,&#8221; he said. He looked round
him. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve never seen our lodge look nicer than
it does to-night; and the fire, and the pot on the fire,
and the smell of the pine-cones, and the cedar-boughs,
and the skins, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And everything,&#8221; she said, with a queer little laugh,
as she moved away again to turn the steaks on the
fire.</p>
<p>Everything! He started at the word. It was so
strange that she should use it by accident, when but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
a little while ago he had been ready to choke the wind
out of a man&#8217;s body for using it concerning herself.</p>
<p>It stunned him for a moment, for the West, and the
life apart from the world of cities, had given him superstition,
like that of the Indians, whose life he had made
his own.</p>
<p>Herself!&mdash;to leave her here, who had been so much to
him? As true as the sun she worshipped, her eyes had
never lingered on another man since she came to his
lodge; and, to her mind, she was as truly sacredly
married to him as though a thousand priests had spoken,
or a thousand Medicine Men had made their incantations.
She was his woman and he was her man. As he
chatted to her, telling her of much that he had done
that day, and wondering how he could tell her of <i>all</i>
he had done, he kept looking round the lodge, his eye
resting on this or that; and everything had its own personal
history, had become part of their lodge-life, because
it had a use as between him and her, and not a
conventional domestic place. Every skin, every utensil,
every pitcher and bowl and pot and curtain had been
with them at one time or another when it became of
importance and renowned in the story of their days and
deeds.</p>
<p>How could he break it to her&mdash;that he was going to
visit his own people, and that she must be alone with
her mother all winter, to await his return in the spring?
His return? As he watched her sitting beside him,
helping him to his favorite dish, the close, companionable
trust and gentleness of her, her exquisite cleanness
and grace in his eyes, he asked himself if, after all, it
was not true that he would return in the spring. The
years had passed without his seriously thinking of this
inevitable day. He had put it off and off, content to
live each hour as it came and take no real thought for
the future; and yet, behind all was the warning fact
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
that he must go one day, and that Mitiahwe could not
go with him. Her mother must have known that when
she let Mitiahwe come to him. Of course; and, after all,
she would find another mate, a better mate, one of her
own people.</p>
<p>But her hand was in his now, and it was small and
very warm, and suddenly he shook with anger at the
thought of one like Breaking Rock taking her to his
wigwam; or Lablache&mdash;this roused him to an inward
fury; and Mitiahwe saw and guessed the struggle that
was going on in him, and she leaned her head against
his shoulder, and once she raised his hand to her lips,
and said, &#8220;My chief!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then his face cleared again, and she got him his pipe
and filled it, and held a coal to light it; and, as the
smoke curled up, and he leaned back contentedly for
the moment, she went to the door, drew open the curtains,
and, stepping outside, raised her eyes to the horseshoe.
Then she said softly to the sky: &#8220;O Sun, great
Father, have pity on me, for I love him, and would keep
him. And give me bone of his bone, and one to nurse
at my breast that is of him. O Sun, pity me this night,
and be near me when I speak to him, and hear what I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing out there, Mitiahwe?&#8221; Dingan
cried; and when she entered again he beckoned her to
him. &#8220;What was it you were saying? Who were you
speaking to?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I heard your voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thanking the Sun for his goodness to me. I
was speaking for the thing that is in my heart, that is
life of my life,&#8221; she added, vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have something to say to you, little girl,&#8221; he
said, with an effort.</p>
<p>She remained erect before him waiting for the blow&mdash;outwardly
calm, inwardly crying out in pain. &#8220;Do you
think you could stand a little parting?&#8221; he asked, reaching
out and touching her shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have been alone before&mdash;for five days,&#8221; she answered,
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it must be longer this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long?&#8221; she asked, with eyes fixed on his. &#8220;If
it is more than a week, I will go too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is longer than a month,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to see my people,&#8221; he faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the <i>Ste. Anne</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded. &#8220;It is the last chance this year; but I
will come back&mdash;in the spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he said it he saw her shrink, and his heart smote
him. Four years such as few men ever spent, and all
the luck had been with him, and the West had got into
his bones! The quiet, starry nights, the wonderful days,
the hunt, the long journeys, the life free of care, and
the warm lodge; and, here, the great couch&mdash;ah, the
cheek pressed to his, the lips that whispered at his ear,
the smooth arm round his neck. It all rushed upon
him now. His people! His people in the East, who
had thwarted his youth, vexed and cramped him, saw
only evil in his widening desires, and threw him over
when he came out West&mdash;the scallywag, they called
him, who had never wronged a man&mdash;or a woman?
Never&mdash;wronged&mdash;a&mdash;woman? The question sprang to
his lips now. Suddenly he saw it all in a new light.
White or brown or red, this heart and soul and body
before him were all his, sacred to him; he was in very
truth her &#8220;chief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Untutored as she was, she read him, felt what was
going on in him. She saw the tears spring to his eyes.
Then, coming close to him, she said, softly, slowly: &#8220;I
must go with you if you go, because you must be with
me when&mdash;Oh, <i>hai-yai</i>, my chief, shall we go from here?
Here in this lodge wilt thou be with thine own people&mdash;thine
own, thou and I&mdash;<i>and thine to come</i>.&#8221; The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
great passion in her heart made the lie seem very
truth.</p>
<p>With a cry he got to his feet, and stood staring at her
for a moment, scarcely comprehending; then suddenly
he clasped her in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mitiahwe&mdash;Mitiahwe, oh, my little girl!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;You and me&mdash;and our own&mdash;our own people!&#8221; Kissing
her, he drew her down beside him on the couch.
&#8220;Tell me again&mdash;is it so at last?&#8221; he said, and she whispered
in his ear once more.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night he said to her, &#8220;Some day,
perhaps, we will go East&mdash;some day, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But now?&#8221; she asked, softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now&mdash;not if I know it,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got my heart nailed to the door of this lodge.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he slept she got quietly out, and, going to the
door of the lodge, reached up a hand and touched the
horseshoe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be good Medicine to me,&#8221; she said. Then she
prayed. &#8220;O Sun, pity me, that it may be as I have
said to him. Oh, pity me, great Father!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the days to come Swift Wing said that it was her
Medicine&mdash;when her hand was burned to the wrist in
the dark ritual she had performed with the Medicine
Man the night that Mitiahwe fought for her man; but
Mitiahwe said it was her Medicine, the horseshoe, which
brought one of Dingan&#8217;s own people to the lodge&mdash;a little
girl with Mitiahwe&#8217;s eyes and form and her father&#8217;s
face. Truth has many mysteries, and the faith of the
woman was great; and so it was that, to the long end,
Mitiahwe kept her man. But truly she was altogether
a woman, and had good-fortune.</p>

<h2>ONCE AT RED MAN&#8217;S RIVER</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to be settled to-night, Nance, This game
is up here, up forever. The redcoat police from Ottawa
are coming, and they&#8217;ll soon be roostin&#8217; in this post, the
Injuns are goin&#8217;, the buffaloes are most gone, and the
fur trade&#8217;s dead in these parts. D&#8217;ye see?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman did not answer the big, broad-shouldered
man bending over her, but remained looking into the
fire with wide, abstracted eyes, and a face somewhat set.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and your brother Bantry&#8217;s got to go. This
store ain&#8217;t worth a cent now. The Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company&#8217;ll
come along with the redcoats, and they&#8217;ll set
up a nice little Sunday-school business here for what
they call &#8216;agricultural settlers.&#8217; There&#8217;ll be a railway,
and the Yankees&#8217;ll send up their marshals to work with
the redcoats on the border, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the days of smuggling will be over,&#8221; put in the
girl, in a low voice. &#8220;No more bull-whackers and mule-skinners
&#8216;whooping-it up&#8217;; no more Blackfeet and Piegans
drinking alcohol and water, and cutting one anothers&#8217;
throats. A nice, quiet time coming on the border
Abe, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked at her queerly. She was not prone
to sarcasm, she had not been given to sentimentalism in
the past; she had taken the border-life as it was, had
looked it straight between the eyes. She had lived up
to it, or down to it, without any fuss, as good as any
man in any phase of the life, and the only white woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
in this whole West country. It was not in the words,
but in the tone, that Abe Hawley found something unusual
and defamatory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, gol darn it, Nance, what&#8217;s got into you? You
bin a man out West, as good a pioneer as ever was on
the border. But now you don&#8217;t sound friendly to what&#8217;s
been the game out here, and to all of us that&#8217;ve been
risking our lives to get a livin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I say?&#8221; asked the girl, unmoved.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t what you said, it&#8217;s the sound o&#8217; your voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know my voice, Abe. It ain&#8217;t always the
same. You ain&#8217;t always about; you don&#8217;t always hear
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught her arm suddenly. &#8220;No, but I want to
hear it always. I want to be always where you are,
Nance. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s got to be settled to-day&mdash;to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s got to be settled to-night!&#8221; said the girl,
meditatively, kicking nervously at a log on the fire.
&#8220;It takes two to settle a thing like that, and there&#8217;s only
one says it&#8217;s got to be settled. Maybe it takes more
than two&mdash;or three&mdash;to settle a thing like that.&#8221; Now
she laughed mirthlessly.</p>
<p>The man started, and his face flushed with anger;
then he put a hand on himself, drew a step back, and
watched her.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>One</i> can settle a thing, if there&#8217;s a dozen in it. You
see, Nance, you and Bantry&#8217;ve got to close out. He&#8217;s
fixing it up to-night over at Dingan&#8217;s Drive, and you
can&#8217;t go it alone when you quit this place. Now, it&#8217;s
this way: you can go West with Bantry, or you can go
North with me. Away North there&#8217;s buffalo and deer,
and game a-plenty, up along the Saskatchewan, and
farther up on the Peace River. It&#8217;s going to be all right
up there for half a lifetime, and we can have it in our
own way yet. There&#8217;ll be no smuggling, but there&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
be trading, and land to get; and, mebbe, there&#8217;d be no
need of smuggling, for we can make it, I know how&mdash;good
white whiskey&mdash;and we&#8217;ll still have this free life
for our own. I can&#8217;t make up my mind to settle down
to a clean collar and going to church on Sundays, and
all that. And the West&#8217;s in your bones, too. You look
like the West&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face brightened with pleasure, and she gazed
at him steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got its beauty and its freshness, and you got
its heat and cold&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw the tobacco-juice stain at the corners of his
mouth, she became conscious of the slight odor of spirits
in the air, and the light in her face lowered in intensity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got the ways of the deer in your walk, the song
o&#8217; the birds in your voice; and you&#8217;re going North with
me, Nance, for I bin talkin&#8217; to you stiddy four years.
It&#8217;s a long time to wait on the chance, for there&#8217;s always
<i>women</i> to be got, same as others have done&mdash;men like
Dingan with Injun girls, and men like Tobey with half-breeds.
But I ain&#8217;t bin lookin&#8217; that way. I bin lookin&#8217;
only toward you.&#8221; He laughed eagerly, and lifted a tin
cup of whiskey standing on a table near. &#8220;I&#8217;m lookin&#8217;
toward you now, Nance. Your health and mine together.
It&#8217;s got to be settled now. You got to go to
the &#8217;Cific Coast with Bantry, or North with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl jerked a shoulder and frowned a little. He
seemed so sure of himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or South with Nick Pringle, or East with someone
else,&#8221; she said, quizzically. &#8220;There&#8217;s always four
quarters to the compass, even when Abe Hawley thinks
he owns the world and has a mortgage on eternity. I&#8217;m
not going West with Bantry, but there&#8217;s three other
points that&#8217;s open.&#8221;</p>
<p>With an oath the man caught her by the shoulders,
and swung her round to face him. He was swelling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
with anger. &#8220;You&mdash;Nick Pringle, that trading cheat,
that gambler! After four years, I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go my shoulders,&#8221; she said, quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
your property. Go and get some Piegan girl to bully.
Keep your hands off. I&#8217;m not a bronco for you to bit
and bridle. You&#8217;ve got no rights. You&mdash;&#8221; Suddenly
she relented, seeing the look in his face, and realizing
that, after all, it was a tribute to herself that she could
keep him for four years and rouse him to such fury.
&#8220;But yes, Abe,&#8221; she added, &#8220;you have some rights.
We&#8217;ve been good friends all these years, and you&#8217;ve
been all right out here. You said some nice things
about me just now, and I liked it, even if it was as if
you&#8217;d learned it out of a book. I&#8217;ve got no po&#8217;try in
me; I&#8217;m plain homespun. I&#8217;m a sapling, I&#8217;m not any
prairie-flower, but I like when I like, and I like a lot
when I like. I&#8217;m a bit of hickory, I&#8217;m not a prairie-flower&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who said you was a prairie-flower? Did I? Who&#8217;s
talking about prairie-flowers&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly, turned round at the sound of
a footstep behind him, and saw, standing in a doorway
leading to another room, a man who was digging his
knuckles into his eyes and stifling a yawn. He was a
refined-looking stripling of not more than twenty-four,
not tall, but well-made, and with an air of breeding,
intensified rather than hidden by his rough clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Je-rick-ety! How long have I slept?&#8221; he said, blinking
at the two beside the fire. &#8220;How long?&#8221; he added,
with a flutter of anxiety in his tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I&#8217;d wake you,&#8221; said the girl, coming forward.
&#8220;You needn&#8217;t have worried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; answered the young man. &#8220;I
dreamed myself awake, I suppose. I got dreaming of
redcoats and U. S. marshals, and an ambush in the
Barfleur Coulée, and&mdash;&#8221; He saw a secret, warning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
gesture from the girl, and laughed, then turned to Abe
and looked him in the face. &#8220;Oh, I know him! Abe
Hawley&#8217;s all O.K.&mdash;I&#8217;ve seen him over at Dingan&#8217;s
Drive. Honor among rogues. We&#8217;re all in it. How
goes it&mdash;all right?&#8221; he added, carelessly, to Hawley, and
took a step forward, as though to shake hands. Seeing
the forbidding look by which he was met, however, he
turned to the girl again, as Hawley muttered something
they could not hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;What time is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nine o&#8217;clock,&#8221; answered the girl, her eyes watching
his every movement, her face alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the moon&#8217;s up almost?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be up in an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jerickety! Then I&#8217;ve got to get ready.&#8221; He turned
to the other room again and entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;College pup!&#8221; said Hawley, under his breath, savagely.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me he was here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it any of your business, Abe?&#8221; she rejoined,
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiding him away here&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiding? Who&#8217;s been hiding him? He&#8217;s doing
what you&#8217;ve done. He&#8217;s smuggling&mdash;the last lot for
the traders over by Dingan&#8217;s Drive. He&#8217;ll get it there
by morning. He has as much right here as you. What&#8217;s
got into you, Abe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he know about the business? Why, he&#8217;s
a college man from the East. I&#8217;ve heard o&#8217; him. Ain&#8217;t
got no more sense for this life than a dicky-bird. White-faced
college pup! What&#8217;s he doing out here? If
you&#8217;re a friend o&#8217; his, you&#8217;d better look after him. He&#8217;s
green.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going East again,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and if I don&#8217;t
go West with Bantry, or South over to Montana with
Nick Pringle, <i>or North</i>&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nance!&#8221; His eyes burned, his lips quivered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>She looked at him and wondered at the power she
had over this bully of the border, who had his own way
with most people, and was one of the most daring
fighters, hunters, and smugglers in the country. He
was cool, hard, and well in hand in his daily life, and
yet, where she was concerned, &#8220;went all to pieces,&#8221; as
some one else had said about himself to her.</p>
<p>She was not without the wiles and tact of her sex.
&#8220;You go now, and come back, Abe,&#8221; she said, in a soft
voice. &#8220;Come back in an hour. Come back then, and
I&#8217;ll tell you which way I&#8217;m going from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was all right again. &#8220;It&#8217;s with you, Nance,&#8221; he
said, eagerly. &#8220;I bin waiting four years.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he closed the door behind him the &#8220;college pup&#8221;
entered the room again. &#8220;Oh, Abe&#8217;s gone!&#8221; he said,
excitedly. &#8220;I hoped you&#8217;d get rid of the old rip-roarer.
I wanted to be alone with you for a while. I don&#8217;t
really need to start yet. With the full moon I can do
it before daylight.&#8221; Then, with quick warmth, &#8220;Ah,
Nancy, Nancy, you&#8217;re a flower&mdash;the flower of all the
prairies,&#8221; he added, catching her hand and laughing
into her eyes.</p>
<p>She flushed, and for a moment seemed almost bewildered.
His boldness, joined to an air of insinuation
and understanding, had influenced her greatly from the
first moment they had met, two months ago, as he was
going South on his smuggling enterprise. The easy
way in which he had talked to her, the extraordinary
sense he seemed to have of what was going on in her
mind, the confidential meaning in voice and tone and
words had, somehow, opened up a side of her nature
hitherto unexplored. She had talked with him freely
then, for it was only when he left her that he said what
he instinctively knew she would remember till they met
again. His quick comments, his indirect but acute
questions, his exciting and alluring reminiscences of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
East, his subtle yet seemingly frank compliments, had
only stimulated a new capacity in her, evoked comparisons
of this delicate-looking, fine-faced gentleman
with the men of the West by whom she was surrounded.
But later he appeared to stumble into expressions of
admiration for her, as though he was carried off his feet
and had been stunned by her charm. He had done it
all like a master. He had not said that she was beautiful&mdash;she
knew she was not&mdash;but that she was wonderful
and fascinating, and with &#8220;something about her&#8221; he
had never seen in all his life: like her own prairies, thrilling,
inspiring, and adorable. His first look at her had
seemed full of amazement. She had noticed that, and
thought it meant only that he was surprised to find
a white girl out here among smugglers, hunters, squaw-men,
and Indians. But he said that the first look at
her had made him feel things, feel life and women different
from ever before; and he had never seen any one
like her, nor a face with so much in it. It was all very
brilliantly done.</p>
<p>&#8220;You make me want to live,&#8221; he had said, and she,
with no knowledge of the nuances of language, had
taken it literally, and had asked him if it had been his
wish to die; and he had responded to her mistaken
interpretation of his meaning, saying that he had had
such sorrow he had not wanted to live. As he said it
his face looked, in truth, overcome by some deep, inward
care; so that there came a sort of feeling she had
never had so far for any man&mdash;that he ought to have
some one to look after him. This was the first real
stirring of the maternal and protective spirit in her toward
men, though it had shown itself amply enough regarding
animals and birds. He had said he had not
wanted to live, and yet he had come out West in order
to try and live, to cure the trouble that had started in
his lungs. The Eastern doctors had told him that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
rough, out-door life would cure him, or nothing would,
and he had vanished from the college walls and the
pleasant purlieus of learning and fashion into the wilds.
He had not lied directly to her when he said that he
had had deep trouble; but he had given the impression
that he was suffering from wrongs which had broken his
spirit and ruined his health. Wrongs there certainly had
been in his life, by whomever committed.</p>
<p>Two months ago he had left this girl with her mind
full of memories of what he had said to her, and there
was something in the sound of the slight cough following
his farewell words which had haunted her ever since.
Her tremendous health and energy, the fire of life burning
so brightly in her, reached out toward this man living
on so narrow a margin of force, with no reserve for any
extra strain, with just enough for each day&#8217;s use and no
more. Four hours before he had come again with his
team of four mules and an Indian youth, having covered
forty miles since his last stage. She was at the door,
and saw him coming while he was yet a long distance
off. Some instinct had told her to watch that afternoon,
for she knew of his intended return and of his dangerous
enterprise. The Indians had trailed south and east,
the traders had disappeared with them, her brother
Bantry had gone up and over to Dingan&#8217;s Drive, and,
save for a few loiterers and last hangers-on, she was
alone with what must soon be a deserted post; its walls,
its great enclosed yard, and its gun-platforms (for it had
been fortified) left for law and order to enter upon, in
the persons of the red-coated watchmen of the law.</p>
<p>Out of the South, from over the border, bringing the
last great smuggled load of whiskey which was to be
handed over at Dingan&#8217;s Drive, and then floated on Red
Man&#8217;s River to settlements up North, came the &#8220;college
pup,&#8221; Kelly Lambton, worn out, dazed with fatigue, but
smiling too, for a woman&#8217;s face was ever a tonic to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
blood since he was big enough to move in life for himself.
It needed courage&mdash;or recklessness&mdash;to run the
border now; for, as Abe Hawley had said, the American
marshals were on the pounce, the red-coated mounted
police were coming west from Ottawa, and word had
winged its way along the prairie that these redcoats were
only a few score miles away, and might be at Fort Stay-Awhile
at any moment. The trail to Dingan&#8217;s Drive
lay past it. Through Barfleur Coulée, athwart a great,
open stretch of country, along a wooded belt, and then,
suddenly, over a ridge, Dingan&#8217;s Drive and Red Man&#8217;s
River would be reached.</p>
<p>The Government had a mind to make an example, if
necessary, by killing some smugglers in conflict, and the
United States marshals had been goaded by vanity and
anger at one or two escapes &#8220;to have something for
their money,&#8221; as they said. That, in their language,
meant, &#8220;to let the red run,&#8221; and Kelly Lambton had
none too much blood to lose.</p>
<p>He looked very pale and beaten as he held Nance
Machell&#8217;s hands now, and called her a prairie-flower, as
he had done when he left her two months before. On
his arrival, but now he had said little, for he saw that
she was glad to see him, and he was dead for sleep, after
thirty-six hours of ceaseless travel and watching and
danger. Now, with the most perilous part of his journey
still before him, and worn physically as he was,
his blood was running faster as he looked into the girl&#8217;s
face, and something in her abundant force and bounding
life drew him to her. Such vitality in a man like Abe
Hawley would have angered him almost, as it did a
little time ago, when Abe was there; but possessed by
the girl, it roused in him a hunger to draw from the well
of her perfect health, from the unused vigor of her
being, something for himself. The touch of her hands
warmed him. In the fulness of her life, in the strong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
eloquence of face and form, he forgot she was not
beautiful. The lightness passed from his words, and
his face became eager.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flower, yes, the flower of the life of the West&mdash;that&#8217;s
what I mean,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are like an army marching.
When I look at you, my blood runs faster. I want
to march too. When I hold your hand I feel that life&#8217;s
worth living&mdash;I want to do things.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew her hand away rather awkwardly. She had
not now that command of herself which had ever been
easy with the men of the West, except, perhaps, with
Abe Hawley when&mdash;</p>
<p>But with an attempt, only half-meant, to turn the
topic, she said: &#8220;You must be starting if you want to
get through to-night. If the redcoats catch you this
side of Barfleur Coulée, or in the Coulée itself, you&#8217;ll
stand no chance. I heard they was only thirty miles
north this afternoon. Maybe they&#8217;ll come straight on
here to-night, instead of camping. If they have news of
your coming, they might. You can&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right.&#8221; He caught her hand again. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got to be going now. But Nance&mdash;Nance&mdash;Nancy,
I want to stay here, here with you; or to take you
with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew back. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Take me with you&mdash;me&mdash;where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;East&mdash;away down East.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her brain throbbed, her pulses beat so hard. She
scarcely knew what to say, did not know what she said.
&#8220;Why do you do this kind of thing? Why do you
smuggle?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You wasn&#8217;t brought up to
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To get this load of stuff through is life and death to
me,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made six thousand dollars
out here. That&#8217;s enough to start me again in the East,
where I lost everything. But I&#8217;ve got to have six
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
hundred dollars clear for the travel&mdash;railways and things;
and I&#8217;m having this last run to get it. Then I&#8217;ve finished
with the West, I guess. My health&#8217;s better; the
lung is closed up, I&#8217;ve only got a little cough now and
again, and I&#8217;m off East. I don&#8217;t want to go alone.&#8221;
He suddenly caught her in his arms. &#8220;I want you&mdash;you,
to go with me, Nancy&mdash;Nance!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her brain swam. To leave the West behind, to go
East to a new life full of pleasant things, as this man&#8217;s
wife! Her great heart rose, and suddenly the mother
in her as well as the woman in her was captured by
his wooing. She had never known what it was to be
wooed like this.</p>
<p>She was about to answer when there came a sharp
knock at the door leading from the back yard, and
Lambton&#8217;s Indian lad entered. &#8220;The soldier&mdash;he come&mdash;many.
I go over the ridge, I see. They come
quick here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nance gave a startled cry, and Lambton turned to
the other room for his pistols, overcoat, and cap, when
there was the sound of horses&#8217; hoofs, the door suddenly
opened, and an officer stepped inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wanted for smuggling, Lambton,&#8221; he said,
brusquely. &#8220;Don&#8217;t stir!&#8221; In his hand was a revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, bosh! Prove it,&#8221; answered the young man,
pale and startled, but cool in speech and action.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll prove it all right. The stuff is hereabouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl said something to the officer in the Chinook
language. She saw he did not understand. Then she
spoke quickly to Lambton in the same tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep him here a bit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His men haven&#8217;t
come yet. Your outfit is well hid. I&#8217;ll see if I can get
away with it before they find it. They&#8217;ll follow, and
bring you with them, that&#8217;s sure. So if I have luck and
get through, we&#8217;ll meet at Dingan&#8217;s Drive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lambton&#8217;s face brightened. He quickly gave her a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
few directions in Chinook, and told her what to do at
Dingan&#8217;s if she got there first. Then she was gone.</p>
<p>The officer did not understand what Nance had said,
but he realized that, whatever she intended to do, she
had an advantage over him. With an unnecessary
courage he had ridden on alone to make his capture,
and, as it proved, without prudence. He had got his
man, but he had not got the smuggled whiskey and
alcohol he had come to seize. There was no time to be
lost. The girl had gone before he realized it. What
had she said to the prisoner? He was foolish enough
to ask Lambton, and Lambton replied coolly: &#8220;She
said she&#8217;d get you some supper, but she guessed it would
have to be cold&mdash;What&#8217;s your name? Are you a
colonel, or a captain, or only a principal private?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Captain MacFee, Lambton. And you&#8217;ll now
bring me where your outfit is. March!&#8221;</p>
<p>The pistol was still in his hand, and he had a determined
look in his eye. Lambton saw it. He was
aware of how much power lay in the threatening face
before him, and how eager that power was to make
itself felt, and provide &#8220;Examples&#8221;; but he took his
chances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll march all right,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll march
to where you tell me. You can&#8217;t have it both ways.
You can take me, because you&#8217;ve found me, and you
can take my outfit, too, when you&#8217;ve found it; but I&#8217;m
not doing your work, not if I know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a blaze of anger in the eyes of the officer,
and it looked for an instant as though something of
the lawlessness of the border was going to mark the
first step of the Law in the Wilderness, but he bethought
himself in time, and said, quietly, yet in a voice which
Lambton knew he must heed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Put on your things&mdash;quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>When this was accomplished, and MacFee had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
secured the smuggler&#8217;s pistols, he said again, &#8220;March,
Lambton!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lambton marched through the moonlit night toward
the troop of men who had come to set up the flag of
order in the plains and hills, and as he went his keen
ear heard his own mules galloping away down toward
the Barfleur Coulée. His heart thumped in his breast.
This girl, this prairie-flower, was doing this for him, was
risking her life, was breaking the law for him. If she
got through, and handed over the whiskey to those who
were waiting for it, and it got bundled into the boats
going North before the redcoats reached Dingan&#8217;s Drive,
it would be as fine a performance as the West had ever
seen; and he would be six hundred dollars to the good.
He listened to the mules galloping, till the sounds had
died into the distance, but he saw now that his captor
had heard too, and that the pursuit would be desperate.</p>
<p>A half-hour later it began, with MacFee at the head
and a dozen troopers pounding behind, weary, hungry,
bad-tempered, ready to exact payment for their hardships
and discouragement.</p>
<p>They had not gone a dozen miles when a shouting
horseman rode furiously on them from behind. They
turned with carbines cocked, but it was Abe Hawley
who cursed them, flung his fingers in their faces, and
rode on harder and harder. Abe had got the news
from one of Nancy&#8217;s half-breeds, and, with the devil
raging in his heart, had entered on the chase. His
spirit was up against them all: against the Law represented
by the troopers camped at Fort Stay-Awhile,
against the troopers and their captain speeding after
Nancy Machell&mdash;his Nance, who was risking her life
and freedom for the hated, pale-faced smuggler riding
between the troopers; and his spirit was up against
Nance herself.</p>
<p>Nance had said to him, &#8220;Come back in an hour,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
he had come back to find her gone. She had broken
her word. She had deceived him. She had thrown
the four years of his waiting to the winds, and a savage
lust was in his heart, which would not be appeased till
he had done some evil thing to some one.</p>
<p>The girl and the Indian lad were pounding through
the night with ears strained to listen for hoof-beats
coming after, with eyes searching forward into the trail
for swollen creeks and direful obstructions. Through
Barfleur Coulée it was a terrible march, for there was
no road, and again and again they were nearly overturned,
while wolves hovered in their path, ready to
reap a midnight harvest. But once in the open again,
with the full moonlight on their trail, the girl&#8217;s spirits
rose. If she could do this thing for the man who had
looked into her eyes as no one had ever done, what a
finish to her days in the West! For they were finished,
finished forever, and she was going&mdash;she was going
East; not West with Bantry, nor South with Nick
Pringle, nor North with Abe Hawley&mdash;ah, Abe Hawley!
He had been a good friend, he had a great heart, he was
the best man of all the Western men she had known;
but another man had come from the East, a man who
had roused something in her never felt before, a man
who had said she was wonderful; and he needed some
one to take good care of him, to make him love life
again. Abe would have been all right if Lambton had
never come, and she had meant to marry Abe in the
end; but it was different now, and Abe must get over
it. Yet she had told Abe to come back in an hour.
He was sure to do it; and, when he had done it, and
found her gone on this errand, what would he do? She
knew what he would do. He would hurt someone.
He would follow, too. But at Dingan&#8217;s Drive, if she
reached it before the troopers and before Abe, and did
the thing she had set out to do; and because no whiskey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
could be found, Lambton must go free; and they all
stood there together, what would be the end? Abe
would be terrible; but she was going East, not North,
and, when the time came she would face it and put things
right somehow.</p>
<p>The night seemed endless to her fixed and anxious
eyes and mind, yet dawn came, and there had fallen no
sound of hoof-beats on her ear. The ridge above Dingan&#8217;s
Drive was reached and covered, but yet there was
no sign of her pursuers. At Red Man&#8217;s River she delivered
her load of contraband to the traders waiting
for it, and saw it loaded into the boats and disappear
beyond the wooded bend above Dingan&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Then she collapsed into the arms of her brother
Bantry, and was carried, fainting, into Dingan&#8217;s Lodge.</p>
<p>A half-hour later MacFee and his troopers and Lambton
came. MacFee grimly searched the post and the
shore, but he saw by the looks of all that he had been
foiled. He had no proof of anything, and Lambton
must go free.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve fooled us,&#8221; he said to Nance, sourly, yet with
a kind of admiration, too. &#8220;Through you, they got
away with it. But I wouldn&#8217;t try it again, if I were
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once is enough,&#8221; answered the girl, laconically, as
Lambton, set free, caught both her hands in his and
whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>MacFee turned to the others. &#8220;You&#8217;d better drop
this kind of thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean business.&#8221; They
saw the troopers by the horses, and nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we was about quit of it anyhow,&#8221; said Bantry.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve had all we want out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>A loud laugh went up, and it was still ringing when
there burst into the group, out of the trail, Abe Hawley,
on foot.</p>
<p>He looked round the group savagely till his eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
rested on Nance and Lambton. &#8220;I&#8217;m last in,&#8221; he said,
in a hoarse voice. &#8220;My horse broke its leg cutting
across to get here before her&mdash;&#8221; He waved a hand
toward Nance. &#8220;It&#8217;s best stickin&#8217; to old trails, not
tryin&#8217; new ones.&#8221; His eyes were full of hate as he
looked at Lambton. &#8220;I&#8217;m keeping to old trails. I&#8217;m
for goin&#8217; North, far up, where these two-dollar-a-day
and hash-and-clothes people ain&#8217;t come yet.&#8221; He
made a contemptuous gesture toward MacFee and his
troopers. &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; North&mdash;&#8221; He took a step forward
and fixed his bloodshot eyes on Nance. &#8220;I say
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; North. You comin&#8217; with me, Nance?&#8221; He
took off his cap to her.</p>
<p>He was haggard, his buckskins were torn, his hair was
dishevelled, and he limped a little; but he was a massive
and striking figure, and MacFee watched him
closely, for there was that in his eyes which meant
trouble. &#8220;You said, &#8216;Come back in an hour,&#8217; Nance,
and I come back, as I said I would,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;You
didn&#8217;t stand to your word. I&#8217;ve come to git it. I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; North, Nance, and I bin waitin&#8217; for four years for
you to go with me. Are you comin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was quiet, but it had a choking kind of
sound, and it struck strangely in the ears of all. MacFee
came nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you comin&#8217; with me, Nance, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached a hand toward Lambton, and he took it,
but she did not speak. Something in Abe&#8217;s eyes overwhelmed
her&mdash;something she had never seen before, and
it seemed to stifle speech in her. Lambton spoke instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going East with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s settled.&#8221;</p>
<p>MacFee started. Then he caught Abe&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Wait!&#8221;
he said, peremptorily. &#8220;Wait one minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something in his voice which held Abe
back for the instant.</p>

THE START ON THE NORTH TRAIL<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You say she is going East with you,&#8221; MacFee said
sharply to Lambton. &#8220;What for?&#8221; He fastened
Lambton with his eyes, and Lambton quailed. &#8220;Have
you told her you&#8217;ve got a wife&mdash;down East? I&#8217;ve got
your history, Lambton. Have you told her that you&#8217;ve
got a wife you married when you were at college&mdash;and
as good a girl as ever lived?&#8221;</p>
<p>It had come with terrible suddenness even to Lambton,
and he was too dazed to make any reply. With a
cry of shame and anger, Nancy started back. Growling
with rage and hate, Abe Hawley sprang toward Lambton,
but the master of the troopers stepped between.</p>
<p>No one could tell who moved first, or who first made
the suggestion, for the minds of all were the same, and
the general purpose was instantaneous; but in the
fraction of a minute Lambton, under menace, was on
his hands and knees crawling to the riverside. Watchful,
but not interfering, the master of the troopers saw
him set adrift in a canoe without a paddle, while he
was pelted with mud from the shore.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The next morning at sunrise Abe Hawley and the
girl he had waited for so long started on the North
trail together, MacFee, master of the troopers and justice
of the peace, handing over the marriage lines.</p>

<h2>THE STROKE OF THE HOUR</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t come to-night&mdash;sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked again toward the west, where, here
and there, bare poles, or branches of trees, or slips of
underbrush, marked a road made across the plains
through the snow. The sun was going down golden
red, folding up the sky a wide, soft curtain of pink and
mauve and deep purple merging into the fathomless
blue, where already the stars were beginning to quiver.
The house stood on the edge of a little forest, which
had boldly asserted itself in the wide flatness. At this
point in the west the prairie merged into an undulating
territory, where hill and wood rolled away from the banks
of the Saskatchewan, making another England in beauty.
The forest was a sort of advance-post of that land of
beauty.</p>
<p>Yet there was beauty, too, on this prairie, though
there was nothing to the east but snow and the forest
so far as eye could see. Nobility and peace and power
brooded over the white world.</p>
<p>As the girl looked, it seemed as though the bosom of
the land rose and fell. She had felt this vibrating life
beat beneath the frozen surface. Now, as she gazed,
she smiled sadly to herself, with drooping eyelids looking
out from beneath strong brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&mdash;I know you,&#8221; she said, aloud. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got to take your toll. And when you&#8217;re lying asleep
like that, or pretending to, you reach up&mdash;and kill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
And yet you can be kind&mdash;ah, but you can be kind
and beautiful! But you must have your toll one way
or t&#8217;other.&#8221; She sighed and paused; then, after a
moment, looking along the trail&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect they&#8217;ll
come to-night, and mebbe not to-morrow, if&mdash;if they
stay for <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes closed, she shivered a little. Her lips drew
tight, and her face seemed suddenly to get thinner.
&#8220;But dad wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;no, he couldn&#8217;t, not considerin&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;
Again she shut her eyes in pain.</p>
<p>Her face was now turned from the western road by
which she had expected her travellers, and toward the
east, where already the snow was taking on a faint
bluish tint, a reflection of the sky deepening toward
night in that half-circle of the horizon. Distant and a
little bleak and cheerless the half-circle was looking now.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one&mdash;not for two weeks,&#8221; she said, in comment
on the eastern trail, which was so little frequented in
winter, and this year had been less travelled than ever.
&#8220;It would be nice to have a neighbor,&#8221; she added, as
she faced the west and the sinking sun again. &#8220;I get
so lonely&mdash;just minutes I get lonely. But it&#8217;s them
minutes that seem to count more than all the rest when
they come. I expect that&#8217;s it&mdash;we don&#8217;t live in months
and years, but just in minutes. It doesn&#8217;t take long
for an earthquake to do its work&mdash;it&#8217;s seconds then....
P&#8217;r&#8217;aps dad won&#8217;t even come to-morrow,&#8221; she added,
as she laid her hand on the latch. &#8220;It never seemed
so long before, not even when he&#8217;s been away a week.&#8221;
She laughed bitterly. &#8220;Even bad company&#8217;s better
than no company at all. Sure. And Mickey has been
here always when dad&#8217;s been away past times. Mickey
was a fool, but he was company; and mebbe he&#8217;d have
been better company if he&#8217;d been more of a scamp and
less a fool. I dunno, but I really think he would. Bad
company doesn&#8217;t put you off so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>There was a scratching at the inside of the door.
&#8220;My, if I didn&#8217;t forget Shako,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and he dying
for a run!&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened the door quickly, and out jumped a
Russian dog of almost full breed, with big, soft eyes
like those of his mistress, and with the air of the north
in every motion&mdash;like his mistress also.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Shako, a run&mdash;a run!&#8221;</p>
<p>An instant after she was flying off on a path toward
the woods, her short skirts flying and showing limbs as
graceful and shapely as those of any woman of that
world of social grace which she had never seen; for she
was a prairie girl through and through, born on the
plains and fed on its scanty fare&mdash;scanty as to variety,
at least. Backward and forward they ran, the girl shouting
like a child of ten&mdash;she was twenty-three&mdash;her eyes
flashing, her fine white teeth showing, her hands thrown
up in sheer excess of animal life, her hair blowing about
her face&mdash;brown, strong hair, wavy and plentiful.</p>
<p>Fine creature as she was, her finest features were her
eyes and her hands. The eyes might have been found
in the most savage places; the hands, however, only
could have come through breeding. She had got them
honestly; for her mother was descended from an old
family of the French province. That was why she had
the name of Loisette&mdash;and had a touch of distinction.
It was the strain of the patrician in the full blood of the
peasant; but it gave her something which made her
what she was&mdash;what she had been since a child, noticeable
and besought, sometimes beloved. It was too
strong a nature to compel love often, but it never failed
to compel admiration. Not greatly a creature of words,
she had become moody of late; and even now, alive with
light and feeling and animal life, she suddenly stopped
her romp and run, and called the dog to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heel, Shako!&#8221; she said, and made for the door of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
the little house, which looked so snug and homelike.
She paused before she came to the door, to watch the
smoke curling up from the chimney straight as a column,
for there was not a breath of air stirring. The sun was
almost gone, and the strong bluish light was settling
on everything, giving even the green spruce-trees a
curious burnished tone.</p>
<p><i>Swish! Thud!</i> She faced the woods quickly. It
was only a sound that she had heard how many hundreds
of times! It was the snow slipping from some
broad branch of the fir-trees to the ground. Yet she
started now. Something was on her mind, agitating
her senses, affecting her self-control.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be jumping out of my boots when the fire snaps,
or the frost cracks the ice, next,&#8221; she said, aloud, contemptuously.
&#8220;I dunno what&#8217;s the matter with me.
I feel as if some one was hiding somewhere ready to pop
out on me. I haven&#8217;t never felt like that before.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had formed the habit of talking to herself, for it
had seemed at first, as she was left alone when her father
went trapping or upon journeys for the Government,
that by-and-by she would start at the sound of her own
voice if she didn&#8217;t think aloud. So she was given to
soliloquy, defying the old belief that people who talked
to themselves were going mad. She laughed at that.
She said that birds sang to themselves and didn&#8217;t go
mad, and crickets chirruped, and frogs croaked, and owls
hooted, and she would talk and not go crazy either.
So she talked to herself and to Shako when she was
alone.</p>
<p>How quiet it was inside when her light supper was
eaten&mdash;bread and beans and pea-soup; she had got this
from her French mother. Now she sat, her elbows on
her knees, her chin on her hands, looking into the fire.
Shako was at her feet upon the great musk-ox rug,
which her father had got on one of his hunting trips in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the Athabasca country years ago. It belonged as she
belonged. It breathed of the life of the north-land, for
the timbers of the hut were hewn cedar; the rough
chimney, the seats, and the shelves on which a few books
made a fair show beside the bright tins and the scanty
crockery, were of pine; and the horned heads of deer
and wapiti made pegs for coats and caps, and rests for
guns and rifles. It was a place of comfort; it had an
air of well-to-do thrift, even as the girl&#8217;s dress, though
plain, was made of good, sound stuff, gray, with a touch
of dark red to match the auburn of her hair.</p>
<p>A book lay open in her lap, but she had scarcely
tried to read it. She had put it down after a few moments
fixed upon it. It had sent her thoughts off into
a world where her life had played a part too big for
books, too deep for the plummet of any save those who
had lived through the storm of life&#8217;s trials; and life
when it is bitter to the young is bitter with an agony
the old never know. At last she spoke to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows now! Now she knows what it is, how it
feels&mdash;your heart like red-hot coals, and something in
your head that&#8217;s like a turnscrew, and you want to die
and can&#8217;t, for you&#8217;ve got to live and suffer!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again she was quiet, and only the dog&#8217;s heavy breathing,
the snap of the fire, or the crack of a timber in the
deadly frost broke the silence. Inside it was warm and
bright and homelike; outside it was twenty degrees below
zero, and like some vast tomb where life itself was
congealed, and only the white stars, low, twinkling, and
quizzical, lived&mdash;a life of sharp corrosion, not of fire.</p>
<p>Suddenly she raised her head and listened. The dog
did the same. None but those whose lives are lived in
lonely places can be so acute, so sensitive to sound.
It was a feeling delicate and intense, the whole nature
getting the vibration. You could have heard nothing,
had you been there; none but one who was of the wide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
spaces could have done so. But the dog and the woman
felt, and both strained toward the window. Again they
heard, and started to their feet. It was far, far away,
and still you could not have heard; but now they heard
clearly&mdash;a cry in the night, a cry of pain and despair.
The girl ran to the window and pulled aside the bearskin
curtain which had completely shut out the light.
Then she stirred the fire, threw a log upon it, snuffed
the candles, hastily put on her moccasins, fur coat, wool
cap, and gloves, and went to the door quickly, the dog
at her heels. Opening it, she stepped out into the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Qui va là?</i> Who is it? Where?&#8221; she called, and
strained toward the west. She thought it might be her
father or Mickey the hired man, or both.</p>
<p>The answer came from the east, out of the homeless,
neighborless, empty east&mdash;a cry, louder now. There
were only stars, and the night was dark, though not
deep dark. She sped along the prairie road as fast as
she could, once or twice stopping to call aloud. In
answer to her calls the voice sounded nearer and nearer.
Now suddenly she left the trail and bore away northward.
At last the voice was very near. Presently a
figure appeared ahead, staggering toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Qui va là?</i> Who is it?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ba&#8217;tiste Caron,&#8221; was the reply in English, in a faint
voice. She was beside him in an instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened? Why are you off the trail?&#8221;
she said, and supported him.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Injun stoled my dogs and run off,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I run after. Then, when I am to come to the trail&#8221;&mdash;he
paused to find the English word, and could not&mdash;&#8220;<i>encore</i>
to this trail I no can. So. Ah, <i>bon Dieu</i>, it
has so awful!&#8221; He swayed and would have fallen, but
she caught him, bore him up. She was so strong, and
he was as slight as a girl, though tall.</p>
<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221; she asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Two nights ago,&#8221; he answered, and swayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said, and pulled a flask from her pocket.
&#8220;Drink this&mdash;quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised it to his lips, but her hand was still on it,
and she only let him take a little. Then she drew it
away, though she had almost to use force, he was so
eager for it. Now she took a biscuit from her pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat; then some more brandy, after,&#8221; she urged.
&#8220;Come on; it&#8217;s not far. See, there&#8217;s the light,&#8221; she
added, cheerily, raising her head toward the hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw it just when I have fall down&mdash;it safe me. I
sit down to die&mdash;like that! But it safe me, that light&mdash;so.
Ah, <i>bon Dieu</i>, it was so far, and I want eat so!&#8221;</p>
<p>Already he had swallowed the biscuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you eat last?&#8221; she asked, as she urged
him on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two nights&mdash;except for one leetla piece of bread&mdash;I
fin&#8217; it in my pocket. <i>Grâce!</i> I have travel so far.
<i>Jésu</i>, I think it ees ten thousan&#8217; miles, I go. But I mus&#8217;
go on, I mus&#8217; go&mdash;<i>certainement</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The light came nearer and nearer. His footsteps
quickened, though he staggered now and then, and
went like a horse that has run its race, but is driven
upon its course again, going heavily with mouth open
and head thrown forward and down.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I mus&#8217; to get there, an&#8217; you&mdash;you will to help
me, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he swayed, but her strong arm held him up.
As they ran on, in a kind of dog-trot, her hand firm
upon his arm&mdash;he seemed not to notice it&mdash;she became
conscious, though it was half dark, of what sort of man
she had saved. He was about her own age, perhaps a
year or two older, with little, if any, hair upon his face,
save a slight mustache. His eyes, deep sunken as they
were, she made out were black, and the face, though
drawn and famished, had a handsome look. Presently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
she gave him another sip of brandy, and he quickened
his steps, speaking to himself the while.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haf to do it&mdash;if I lif. It is to go, go, go, till I
get.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now they came to the hut where the firelight flickered
on the window-pane; the door was flung open, and, as
he stumbled on the threshold, she helped him into the
warm room. She almost pushed him over to the fire.</p>
<p>Divested of his outer coat, muffler, cap, and leggings,
he sat on a bench before the fire, his eyes wandering
from the girl to the flames, and his hands clasping and
unclasping between his knees. His eyes dilating with
hunger, he watched her preparations for his supper;
and when at last&mdash;and she had been but a moment&mdash;it
was placed before him, his head swam, and he turned
faint with the stress of his longing. He would have
swallowed a basin of pea-soup at a draught, but she
stopped him, holding the basin till she thought he
might venture again. Then came cold beans, and
some meat which she toasted at the fire and laid upon
his plate. They had not spoken since first entering the
house, when tears had shone in his eyes, and he had said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have safe&mdash;ah, you have safe me, and so I will
do it yet by help <i>bon Dieu</i>&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meal was done at last, and he sat with a great
dish of tea beside him, and his pipe alight.</p>
<p>&#8220;What time, if please?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I t&#8217;ink nine
hour, but no sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is near nine,&#8221; she said. She hastily tidied up
the table after his meal, and then came and sat in her
chair over against the wall of the rude fireplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine&mdash;dat is good. The moon rise at &#8217;leven; den
I go. I go on,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you show me de queeck
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You go on&mdash;how can you go on?&#8221; she asked, almost
sharply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will you not to show me?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Show you what?&#8221; she asked, abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The queeck way to Askatoon,&#8221; he said, as though
surprised that she should ask. &#8220;They say me if I get
here you will tell me queeck way to Askatoon. Time,
he go so fas&#8217;, an&#8217; I have loose a day an&#8217; a night, an&#8217; I
mus&#8217; get Askatoon if I lif&mdash;I mus&#8217; get dere in time. It
is all safe to de stroke of de hour, <i>mais</i>, after, it is&mdash;<i>bon
Dieu</i>!&mdash;it is hell then. Who shall forgif me&mdash;no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stroke of the hour&mdash;the stroke of the hour!&#8221;
It beat into her brain. Were they both thinking of
the same thing now?</p>
<p>&#8220;You will show me queeck way. I mus&#8217; be Askatoon
in two days, or it is all over,&#8221; he almost moaned. &#8220;Is
no man here&mdash;I forget dat name, my head go round like
a wheel; but I know dis place, an&#8217; de good God, He
help me fin&#8217; my way to where I call out, <i>bien sûr</i>. Dat
man&#8217;s name I have forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father&#8217;s name is John Alroyd,&#8221; she answered,
absently, for there were hammering at her brain the
words, &#8220;<i>The stroke of the hour.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, now I get&mdash;yes. An&#8217; your name, it is Loisette
Alroy&mdash;ah, I have it in my mind now&mdash;Loisette. I
not forget dat name, I not forget you&mdash;no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you want to go the &#8216;quick&#8217; way to Askatoon?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>He puffed a moment at his pipe before he answered
her. Presently he said, holding out his pipe, &#8220;You not
like smoke, mebbe?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head in negation, making an impatient
gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forget ask you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dat journee make me
forget. When Injun Jo, he leave me with the dogs, an&#8217;
I wake up all alone, an&#8217; not know my way&mdash;not like
Jo, I think I die, it is so bad, so <i>terrible</i> in my head.
Not&#8217;ing but snow, not&#8217;ing. But dere is de sun; it shine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
It say to me, &#8216;Wake up, Ba&#8217;tiste; it will be all right
bime-bye.&#8217; But all time I t&#8217;ink I go mad, for I mus&#8217;
get Askatoon before&mdash;<i>dat</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>She started. Had she not used the same word in
thinking of Askatoon. &#8220;<i>That</i>,&#8221; she had said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you want to go the &#8216;quick&#8217; way to Askatoon?&#8221;
she asked again, her face pale, her foot beating
the floor impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;To save him before <i>dat</i>!&#8221; he answered, as though
she knew of what he was speaking and thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is <i>that</i>?&#8221; she asked. She knew now, surely,
but she must ask it nevertheless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat hanging&mdash;of Haman,&#8221; he answered. He nodded
to himself. Then he took to gazing into the fire. His
lips moved as though talking to himself, and the hand
that held the pipe lay forgotten on his knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you to do with Haman?&#8221; she asked,
slowly, her eyes burning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want safe him&mdash;I mus&#8217; give him free.&#8221; He tapped
his breast. &#8220;It is here to mak&#8217; him free.&#8221; He still
tapped his breast.</p>
<p>For a moment she stood frozen still, her face thin
and drawn and white; then suddenly the blood rushed
back into her face, and a red storm raged in her eyes.</p>
<p>She thought of the sister, younger than herself, whom
Rube Haman had married and driven to her grave within
a year&mdash;the sweet Lucy, with the name of her father&#8217;s
mother. Lucy had been all English in face and tongue,
a flower of the west, driven to darkness by this horse-dealing
brute, who, before he was arrested and tried
for murder, was about to marry Kate Wimper. Kate
Wimper had stolen him from Lucy before Lucy&#8217;s first
and only child was born, the child that could not survive
the warm mother-life withdrawn, and so had gone
down the valley whither the broken-hearted mother had
fled. It was Kate Wimper, who, before that, had waylaid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
the one man for whom she herself had ever cared,
and drawn him from her side by such attractions as she
herself would keep for an honest wife, if such she ever
chanced to be. An honest wife she would have been
had Kate Wimper not crossed the straight path of her
life. The man she had loved was gone to his end also,
reckless and hopeless, after he had thrown away his
chance of a lifetime with Loisette Alroyd. There had
been left behind this girl, to whom tragedy had come
too young, who drank humiliation with a heart as proud
as ever straightly set its course through crooked ways.</p>
<p>It had hurt her, twisted her nature a little, given a
fountain of bitterness to her soul, which welled up and
flooded her life sometimes. It had given her face no
sourness, but it put a shadow into her eyes.</p>
<p>She had been glad when Haman was condemned for
murder, for she believed he had committed it, and ten
times hanging could not compensate for that dear life
gone from their sight&mdash;Lucy, the pride of her father&#8217;s
heart. She was glad when Haman was condemned,
because of the woman who had stolen him from Lucy,
because of that other man, her lover, gone out of her
own life. The new hardness in her rejoiced that now
the woman, if she had any heart at all, must have it
bowed down by this supreme humiliation and wrung by
the ugly tragedy of the hempen rope.</p>
<p>And now this man before her, this man with a boy&#8217;s
face, with the dark, luminous eyes, whom she had saved
from the frozen plains, he had that in his breast which
would free Haman, so he had said. A fury had its
birth in her at that moment. Something seemed to
seize her brain and master it, something so big that it
held all her faculties in perfect control, and she felt
herself in an atmosphere where all life moved round her
mechanically, she herself the only sentient thing, so
much greater than all she saw, or all that she realized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
by her subconscious self. Everything in the world
seemed small. How calm it was even with the fury
within!</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she said, quietly&mdash;&#8220;tell me how you are
able to save Haman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He not kill Wakely. It is my brudder Fadette dat
kill and get away. Haman he is drunk, and everyt&#8217;ing
seem to say Haman he did it, an&#8217; every one know Haman
is not friend to Wakely. So the juree say he must be
hanging. But my brudder he go to die with hawful
bad cold queeck, an&#8217; he send for the priest an&#8217; for me,
an&#8217; tell all. I go to Governor with the priest, an&#8217;
Governor gif me dat writing here.&#8221; He tapped his
breast, then took out a wallet and showed the paper to
her. &#8220;It is life of dat Haman, <i>voici</i>! And so I safe
him for my brudder. Dat was a bad boy, Fadette.
He was bad all time since he was a baby, an&#8217; I t&#8217;ink
him pretty lucky to die on his bed, an&#8217; get absolve, and
go to purgatore. If he not have luck like dat he go to
hell, an&#8217; stay there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sighed, and put the wallet back in his breast carefully,
his eyes half shut with weariness, his handsome
face drawn and thin, his limbs lax with fatigue.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I get Askatoon before de time for <i>dat</i>, I be happy
in my heart, for dat brudder off mine he get out of
purgatore bime-bye, I t&#8217;ink.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes were almost shut, but he drew himself together
with a great effort, and added desperately: &#8220;No
sleep. If I sleep it is all smash. Man say me I can
get Askatoon by dat time from here, if I go queeck way
across lak&#8217;&mdash;it is all froze now, dat lak&#8217;&mdash;an&#8217; down dat
Foxtail Hills. Is it so, ma&#8217;m&#8217;selle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the &#8216;quick&#8217; way if you can make it in time,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;but it is no way for the stranger to go. There
are always bad spots on the ice&mdash;it is not safe. You
could not find your way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I mus&#8217; get dere in time,&#8221; he said, desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it&mdash;alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do you want
to risk all and lose?&#8221;</p>
<p>He frowned in self-suppression. &#8220;Long way, I no
can get dere in time?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She thought a moment. &#8220;No; it can&#8217;t be done by
the long way. But there is another way&mdash;a third trail,
the trail the Gover&#8217;ment men made a year ago when
they came to survey. It is a good trail. It is blazed
in the woods and staked on the plains. You cannot
miss. But&mdash;but there is so little time.&#8221; She looked at
the clock on the wall. &#8220;You cannot leave here much
before sunrise, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will leef when de moon rise, at eleven,&#8221; he interjected.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have had no sleep for two nights, and no food.
You can&#8217;t last it out,&#8221; she said, calmly.</p>
<p>The deliberate look on his face deepened to stubbornness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my vow to my brudder&mdash;he is in purgatore.
An&#8217; I mus&#8217; do it,&#8221; he rejoined, with an emphasis there
was no mistaking. &#8220;You can show me dat way?&#8221;</p>
<p>She went to a drawer and took out a piece of paper.
Then, with a point of blackened stick, as he watched
her and listened, she swiftly drew his route for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I get it in my head,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I go dat way,
but I wish&mdash;I wish it was dat queeck way. I have
no fear, not&#8217;ing. I go w&#8217;en dat moon rise&mdash;I go, <i>bien
sûr.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must sleep, then, while I get some food for
you.&#8221; She pointed to a couch in a corner. &#8220;I will
wake you when the moon rises.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time he seemed to realize her, for a
moment to leave the thing which consumed him, and
put his mind upon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You not happy&mdash;you not like me here?&#8221; he asked,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
simply; then added, quickly, &#8220;I am not bad man like
me brudder&mdash;no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes rested on him for a moment as though
realizing him, while some thought was working in her
mind behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you are not a bad man,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Men and
women are equal on the plains. You have no fear&mdash;I
have no fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced at the rifles on the walls, then back at
her. &#8220;My mudder, she was good woman. I am glad
she did not lif to know what Fadette do.&#8221; His eyes
drank her in for a minute, then he said: &#8220;I go sleep now,
t&#8217;ank you&mdash;till moontime.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a moment his deep breathing filled the room, the
only sound save for the fire within and the frost outside.</p>
<p>Time went on. The night deepened.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Loisette sat beside the fire, but her body was half-turned
from it toward the man on the sofa. She was
not agitated outwardly, but within there was that fire
which burns up life and hope and all the things that
come between us and great issues. It had burned up
everything in her except one thought, one powerful
motive. She had been deeply wronged, and justice
had been about to give &#8220;an eye for an eye and a tooth
for a tooth.&#8221; But the man lying there had come to
sweep away the scaffolding of justice&mdash;he had come for
that.</p>
<p>Perhaps he might arrive at Askatoon before the
stroke of the hour, but still he would be too late, for
in her pocket now was the Governor&#8217;s reprieve. The
man had slept soundly. His wallet was still in his
breast; but the reprieve was with her.</p>
<p>If he left without discovering his loss, and got well
on his way, and discovered it then, it would be too late.
If he returned&mdash;she only saw one step before her, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
would wait for that, and deal with it when it came.
She was thinking of Lucy, of her own lover ruined and
gone. She was calm in her madness.</p>
<p>At the first light of the moon she roused him. She
had put food into his fur-coat pocket, and after he had
drunk a bowl of hot pea-soup, while she told him his
course again, she opened the door, and he passed out
into the night. He started forward without a word,
but came back again and caught her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Pardon</i>,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I go forget everyt&#8217;ing except
<i>dat</i>. But I t&#8217;ink what you do for me, it is better than
all my life. <i>Bien sûr</i>, I will come again, when I get my
mind to myself. Ah, but you are beautibul,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;an&#8217; you not happy. Well, I come again&mdash;yes, <i>à Dieu.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>He was gone into the night, with the moon silvering
the sky, and the steely frost eating into the sentient
life of this northern world. Inside the house, with the
bearskin blind dropped at the window again, and the
fire blazing high, Loisette sat with the Governor&#8217;s
reprieve in her hand. Looking at it, she wondered why
it had been given to Ba&#8217;tiste Caron and not to a police-officer.
Ah yes, it was plain&mdash;Ba&#8217;tiste was a woodsman
and plainsman, and could go far more safely than a
constable, and faster. Ba&#8217;tiste had reason for going
fast, and he would travel night and day&mdash;he was travelling
night and day indeed. And now Ba&#8217;tiste might
get there, but the reprieve would not. He would not
be able to stop the hanging of Haman&mdash;the hanging
of Rube Haman.</p>
<p>A change came over her. Her eyes blazed, her
breast heaved now. She had been so quiet, so cold and
still. But life seemed moving in her once again. The
woman, Kate Wimper, who had helped to send two
people to their graves, would now drink the dregs of
shame, if she was capable of shame&mdash;would be robbed
of her happiness, if so be she loved Rube Haman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>She stood up, as though to put the paper in the fire,
but paused suddenly at one thought&mdash;<i>Rube Haman was
innocent of murder.</i></p>
<p>Even so, he was not innocent of Lucy&#8217;s misery and
death, or the death of the little one who only opened its
eyes to the light for an instant, and then went into the
dark again. But truly she was justified! When Haman
was gone things would go on just the same&mdash;and she
had been so bitter, her heart had been pierced as with
a knife these past three years. Again she held out her
hand to the fire, but suddenly she gave a little cry and
put her hand to her head. There was Ba&#8217;tiste!</p>
<p>What was Ba&#8217;tiste to her? Nothing&mdash;nothing at all.
She had saved his life&mdash;even if she wronged Ba&#8217;tiste,
her debt would be paid. No, she would not think of
Ba&#8217;tiste. Yet she did not put the paper in the fire, but
in the pocket of her dress. Then she went to her room,
leaving the door open. The bed was opposite the fire,
and, as she lay there&mdash;she did not take off her clothes,
she knew not why&mdash;she could see the flames. She
closed her eyes but could not sleep, and more than
once when she opened them she thought she saw Ba&#8217;tiste
sitting there as he had sat hours before. Why did
Ba&#8217;tiste haunt her so? What was it he had said in his
broken English as he went away?&mdash;that he would come
back; that she was &#8220;beautibul.&#8221;</p>
<p>All at once as she lay still, her head throbbing, her
feet and hands icy cold, she sat up listening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;again!&#8221; she cried. She sprang from her bed,
rushed to the door, and strained her eyes into the silver
night. She called into the icy void, &#8220;<i>Qui va là?</i> Who
goes?&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned forward, her hand at her ear, but no
sound came in reply. Once more she called, but
nothing answered. The night was all light and frost
and silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>She had only heard, in her own brain, the iteration
of Ba&#8217;tiste&#8217;s calling. Would he reach Askatoon in time?
she wondered, as she shut the door. Why had she
not gone with him and attempted the shorter way&mdash;the
quick way, he had called it? All at once the truth
came back upon her, stirring her now. It would do no
good for Ba&#8217;tiste to arrive in time. He might plead to
them all and tell the truth about the reprieve, but it
would not avail&mdash;Rube Haman would hang. That did
not matter&mdash;even though he was innocent; but Ba&#8217;tiste&#8217;s
brother would be so long in purgatory. And even that
would not matter; but she would hurt Ba&#8217;tiste&mdash;Ba&#8217;tiste&mdash;Ba&#8217;tiste!
And Ba&#8217;tiste he would know that she&mdash;and
he had called her &#8220;beautibul&#8221;&mdash;that she had&mdash;</p>
<p>With a cry she suddenly clothed herself for travel.
She put some food and drink in a leather bag and slung
them over her shoulder. Then she dropped on a knee
and wrote a note to her father, tears falling from her
eyes. She heaped wood on the fire and moved toward
the door. All at once she turned to the crucifix on the
wall which had belonged to her mother, and, though
she had followed her father&#8217;s Protestant religion, she
kissed the feet of the sacred figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Christ, have mercy on me, and bring me safe
to my journey&#8217;s end&mdash;in time,&#8221; she said, breathlessly;
then she went softly to the door, leaving the dog behind.</p>
<p>It opened, closed, and the night swallowed her. Like
a ghost she sped the quick way to Askatoon. She was
six hours behind Ba&#8217;tiste, and, going hard all the time,
it was doubtful if she could get there before the fatal hour.</p>
<p>On the trail Ba&#8217;tiste had taken there were two huts
where he could rest, and he had carried his blanket
slung on his shoulder. The way she went gave no
shelter save the trees and caves which had been used
to <i>câche</i> buffalo meat and hides in old days. But beyond
this there was danger in travelling by night, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
the springs beneath the ice of the three lakes she must
cross made it weak and rotten even in the fiercest
weather, and what would no doubt have been death to
Ba&#8217;tiste would be peril at least to her. Why had she
not gone with him?</p>
<p>&#8220;He had in his face what was in Lucy&#8217;s,&#8221; she said to
herself, as she sped on. &#8220;She was fine like him, ready
to break her heart for those she cared for. My, if she
had seen him first instead of&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped short, for the ice gave way to her foot,
and she only sprang back in time to save herself. But
she trotted on, mile after mile, the dog-trot of the Indian,
head bent forward, toeing in, breathing steadily but
sharply.</p>
<p>The morning came, noon, then a fall of snow and a
keen wind, and despair in her heart; but she had passed
the danger-spots, and now, if the storm did not overwhelm
her, she might get to Askatoon in time. In the
midst of the storm she came to one of the caves of
which she had known. Here was wood for a fire, and
here she ate, and in weariness unspeakable fell asleep.
When she waked it was near sundown, the storm had
ceased, and, as on the night before, the sky was stained
with color and drowned in splendor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do it&mdash;I will do it, Ba&#8217;tiste!&#8221; she called, and
laughed aloud into the sunset. She had battled with
herself all the way, and she had conquered. Right was
right, and Rube Haman must not be hung for what he
did not do. Her heart hardened whenever she thought
of the woman, but softened again when she thought of
Ba&#8217;tiste, who had to suffer for the deed of a brother in
&#8220;purgatore.&#8221; Once again the night and its silence and
loneliness followed her, the only living thing near the
trail till long after midnight. After that, as she knew,
there were houses here and there where she might have
rested, but she pushed on unceasing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>At daybreak she fell in with a settler going to Askatoon
with his dogs. Seeing how exhausted she was, he
made her ride a few miles upon his sledge; then she
sped on ahead again till she came to the borders of
Askatoon.</p>
<p>People were already in the streets, and all were tending
one way. She stopped and asked the time. It was
within a quarter of an hour of the time when Haman
was to pay another&#8217;s penalty. She spurred herself on,
and came to the jail blind with fatigue. As she neared
the jail she saw her father and Mickey. In amazement
her father hailed her, but she would not stop. She was
admitted to the prison on explaining that she had a
reprieve. Entering a room filled with excited people,
she heard a cry.</p>
<p>It came from Ba&#8217;tiste. He had arrived but ten
minutes before, and, in the Sheriff&#8217;s presence, had discovered
his loss. He had appealed in vain.</p>
<p>But now, as he saw the girl, he gave a shout of joy
which pierced the hearts of all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you haf it! Say you haf it, or it is no use&mdash;he
mus&#8217; hang. Spik&mdash;spik! Ah, my brudder&mdash;it is to
do him right! Ah, Loisette&mdash;<i>bon Dieu, merci!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer she placed the reprieve in the hands of
the Sheriff. Then she swayed and fell fainting at the
feet of Ba&#8217;tiste.</p>
<p>She had come at the stroke of the hour.</p>
<p>When she left for her home again the Sheriff kissed
her.</p>
<p>And that was not the only time he kissed her. He
did it again six months later, at the beginning of the
harvest, when she and Ba&#8217;tiste Caron started off on the
long trail of life together. None but Ba&#8217;tiste knew the
truth about the loss of the reprieve, and to him she was
&#8220;beautibul&#8221; just the same, and greatly to be desired.</p>

<h2>BUCKMASTER&#8217;S BOY</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I bin waitin&#8217; for him, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll git him ef it takes all
winter. I&#8217;ll get him&mdash;plumb.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker smoothed the barrel of his rifle with
mittened hand, which had, however, a trigger-finger
free. With black eyebrows twitching over sunken gray
eyes, he looked doggedly down the frosty valley from
the ledge of high rock where he sat. The face was
rough and weather-beaten, with the deep tan got in
the open life of a land of much sun and little cloud,
and he had a beard which, untrimmed and growing
wild, made him look ten years older than he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I bin waitin&#8217; a durn while,&#8221; the mountain-man
added, and got to his feet slowly, drawing himself out
to six and a half feet of burly manhood. The shoulders
were, however, a little stooped, and the head was thrust
forward with an eager, watchful look&mdash;a habit become
a physical characteristic.</p>
<p>Presently he caught sight of a hawk sailing southward
along the peaks of the white icebound mountains
above, on which the sun shone with such sharp insistence,
making sky and mountain of a piece in deep purity and
serene stillness.</p>
<p>&#8220;That hawk&#8217;s seen him, mebbe,&#8221; he said, after a
moment. &#8220;I bet it went up higher when it got him in
its eye. Ef it&#8217;d only speak and tell me where he is&mdash;ef
he&#8217;s a day, or two days, or ten days north.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly his eyes blazed and his mouth opened in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
superstitious amazement, for the hawk stopped almost
directly overhead at a great height, and swept round in
a circle many times, waveringly, uncertainly. At last
it resumed its flight southward, sliding down the mountains
like a winged star.</p>
<p>The mountaineer watched it with a dazed expression
for a moment longer, then both hands clutched the rifle
and half swung it to position involuntarily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s seen him, and it stopped to say so. It&#8217;s seen
him, I tell you, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll git him. Ef it&#8217;s an hour, or a
day, or a week, it&#8217;s all the same. I&#8217;m here watchin&#8217;,
waitin&#8217; dead on to him, the poison skunk!&#8221;</p>
<p>The person to whom he had been speaking now rose
from the pile of cedar boughs where he had been sitting,
stretched his arms up, then shook himself into place,
as does a dog after sleep. He stood for a minute looking
at the mountaineer with a reflective yet a furtively
sardonic look. He was not above five feet nine inches
in height, and he was slim and neat; and though his
buckskin coat and breeches were worn and even frayed
in spots, he had an air of some distinction and of concentrated
force. It was a face that men turned to look
at twice and shook their heads in doubt afterward&mdash;a
handsome, worn, secretive face, in as perfect control as
the strings of an instrument under the bow of a great
artist. It was the face of a man without purpose in
life beyond the moment&mdash;watchful, careful, remorselessly
determined, an adventurer&#8217;s asset, the dial-plate
of a hidden machinery.</p>
<p>Now he took the handsome meerschaum pipe from
his mouth, from which he had been puffing smoke slowly,
and said in a cold, yet quiet voice, &#8220;How long you
been waitin&#8217;, Buck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A month. He&#8217;s overdue near that. He always
comes down to winter at Fort o&#8217; Comfort, with his
string of half-breeds, an&#8217; Injuns, an&#8217; the dogs.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No chance to get him at the Fort?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t so certain. They&#8217;d guess what I was doin&#8217;
there. It&#8217;s surer here. He&#8217;s got to come down the
trail, an&#8217; when I spot him by the Juniper clump&#8221;&mdash;he
jerked an arm toward a spot almost a mile farther up
the valley&mdash;&#8220;I kin scoot up the underbrush a bit and
git him&mdash;plumb. I could do it from here, sure, but
I don&#8217;t want no mistake. Once only, jest one shot,
that&#8217;s all I want, Sinnet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bit off a small piece of tobacco from a black plug
Sinnet offered him, and chewed it with nervous fierceness,
his eyebrows working, as he looked at the other
eagerly. Deadly as his purpose was, and grim and
unvarying as his vigil had been, the loneliness had told
on him, and he had grown hungry for a human face and
human companionship. Why Sinnet had come he had
not thought to inquire. Why Sinnet should be going
north instead of south had not occurred to him. He
only realized that Sinnet was not the man he was waiting
for with murder in his heart; and all that mattered
to him in life was the coming of his victim down the
trail. He had welcomed Sinnet with a sullen eagerness,
and had told him in short, detached sentences the dark
story of a wrong and a waiting revenge, which brought
a slight flush to Sinnet&#8217;s pale face and awakened a curious
light in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that your shack&mdash;that where you shake down?&#8221;
Sinnet said, pointing toward a lean-to in the fir-trees to
trees to the right.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. I sleep there. It&#8217;s straight on to the
Juniper clump, the front door is.&#8221; He laughed viciously,
grimly. &#8220;Outside or inside, I&#8217;m on to the Juniper
clump. Walk into the parlor?&#8221; he added, and drew
open a rough-made door, so covered with green cedar
boughs that it seemed of a piece with the surrounding
underbrush and trees. Indeed, the little hut was so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
constructed that it could not be distinguished from the
woods even a short distance away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t have a fire, I suppose?&#8221; Sinnet asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not daytimes. Smoke &#8217;d give me away if he suspicioned
me,&#8221; answered the mountaineer. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
take no chances. Never can tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Water?&#8221; asked Sinnet, as though interested in the
surroundings, while all the time he was eying the
mountaineer furtively&mdash;as it were, prying to the inner
man, or measuring the strength of the outer man. He
lighted a fresh pipe and seated himself on a rough
bench beside the table in the middle of the room, and
leaned on his elbows, watching.</p>
<p>The mountaineer laughed. It was not a pleasant
laugh to hear. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You bin a long
time out West. You bin in the mountains a good while.
Listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence. Sinnet listened intently. He
heard the faint drip, drip, drip of water, and looked
steadily at the back wall of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&mdash;rock?&#8221; he said, and jerked his head toward
the sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got good ears,&#8221; answered the other, and drew
aside a blanket which hung on the back wall of the
room. A wooden trough was disclosed hanging under
a ledge of rock, and water dripped into it softly, slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost providential, that rock,&#8221; remarked Sinnet.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got your well at your back door. Food&mdash;but
you can&#8217;t go far, and keep your eye on the Bend too,&#8221;
he nodded toward the door, beyond which lay the
frost-touched valley in the early morning light of
autumn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of black squirrels and pigeons come here on
account of the springs like this one, and I get &#8217;em with
a bow and arrow. I didn&#8217;t call myself Robin Hood and
Daniel Boone not for nothin&#8217; when I was knee-high to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
a grasshopper.&#8221; He drew from a rough cupboard some
cold game, and put it on the table, with some scones
and a pannikin of water. Then he brought out a small
jug of whiskey and placed it beside his visitor. They
began to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye cook without fire?&#8221; asked Sinnet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire&#8217;s all right at nights. He&#8217;d never camp &#8217;twixt
here an&#8217; Juniper Bend at night. The next camp&#8217;s six
miles north from here. He&#8217;d only come down the valley
daytimes. I studied it all out, and it&#8217;s a dead sure
thing. From daylight till dusk I&#8217;m on to him&mdash;I got
the trail in my eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>He showed his teeth like a wild dog, as his look swept
the valley. There was something almost revolting in
his concentrated ferocity.</p>
<p>Sinnet&#8217;s eyes half closed as he watched the mountaineer,
and the long, scraggy hands and whipcord neck
seemed to interest him greatly. He looked at his own
slim, brown hands with a half smile, and it was almost
as cruel as the laugh of the other. Yet it had, too,
a knowledge and an understanding which gave it
humanity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure he did it?&#8221; Sinnet asked, presently,
after drinking a very small portion of liquor, and tossing
some water from the pannikin after it. &#8220;You&#8217;re
sure Greevy killed your boy, Buck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Buckmaster, ain&#8217;t it&mdash;Jim Buckmaster?
Don&#8217;t I know my own name? It&#8217;s as sure as that.
My boy said it was Greevy when he was dying. He
told Bill Ricketts so, and Bill told me afore he went
East. Bill didn&#8217;t want to tell, but he said it was fair
I should know, for my boy never did nobody any harm&mdash;an&#8217;
Greevy&#8217;s livin&#8217; on! But I&#8217;ll git him. Right&#8217;s
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better for the law to hang him if
you&#8217;ve got the proof, Buck? A year or so in jail, an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
a long time to think over what&#8217;s going round his neck
on the scaffold&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t that suit you, if you&#8217;ve got
the proof?&#8221;</p>
<p>A rigid, savage look came into Buckmaster&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t lettin&#8217; no judge and jury do my business.
I&#8217;m for certain sure, not for <i>p&#8217;r&#8217;aps</i>! An&#8217; I want to do
it myself. Clint was only twenty. Like boys we was
together. I was eighteen when I married, an&#8217; he come
when <i>she</i> went&mdash;jest a year&mdash;jest a year. An&#8217; ever since
then we lived together, him an&#8217; me, an&#8217; shot together,
an&#8217; trapped together, an&#8217; went gold-washin&#8217; together
on the Cariboo, an&#8217; eat out of the same dish, an&#8217; slept
under the same blanket, and jawed together nights&mdash;ever
since he was five, when old Mother Lablache
had got him into pants, an&#8217; he was fit to take the
trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man stopped a minute, his whipcord neck
swelling, his lips twitching. He brought a fist down on
the table with a bang. &#8220;The biggest little rip he was,
as full of fun as a squirrel, an&#8217; never a smile&mdash;jest his
eyes dancin&#8217;, an&#8217; more sense than a judge. He laid
hold o&#8217; me, that cub did&mdash;it was like his mother and
himself together; an&#8217; the years flowin&#8217; in an&#8217; peterin&#8217;
out, an&#8217; him gettin&#8217; older, an&#8217; always jest the same.
Always on rock-bottom, always bright as a dollar, an&#8217;
we livin&#8217; at Black Nose Lake, layin&#8217; up cash agin&#8217; the
time we was to go South, an&#8217; set up a house along the
railway, an&#8217; him to git married. I was for his gittin&#8217;
married same as me, when we had enough cash. I use
to think of that when he was ten, and when he was
eighteen I spoke to him about it; but he wouldn&#8217;t listen&mdash;jest
laughed at me. You remember how Clint used
to laugh, sort of low and teasin&#8217; like&mdash;you remember
that laugh o&#8217; Clint&#8217;s, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinnet&#8217;s face was toward the valley and Juniper
Bend, but he slowly turned his head and looked at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
Buckmaster strangely out of his half-shut eyes. He
took the pipe from his mouth slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hear it now,&#8221; he answered, slowly. &#8220;I hear
it often, Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man gripped his arm so suddenly that Sinnet
was startled&mdash;in so far as anything could startle any
one who had lived a life of chance and danger and
accident&mdash;and his face grew a shade paler; but he
did not move, and Buckmaster&#8217;s hand tightened
convulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;You liked him, an&#8217; he liked you; he first learnt
poker off you, Sinnet. He thought you was a tough,
but he didn&#8217;t mind that no more than I did. It ain&#8217;t
for us to say what we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to be, not always. Things
in life git stronger than we are. You was a tough, but
who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to judge you? I ain&#8217;t; for Clint took to
you, Sinnet, an&#8217; he never went wrong in his thinkin&#8217;.
God! he was wife an&#8217; child to me&mdash;an&#8217; he&#8217;s dead&mdash;dead&mdash;dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s grief was a painful thing to see. His
hands gripped the table, while his body shook with
sobs, though his eyes gave forth no tears. It was an
inward convulsion, which gave his face the look of
unrelieved tragedy and suffering&mdash;Laocoon struggling
with the serpents of sorrow and hatred which were
strangling him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead an&#8217; gone,&#8221; he repeated, as he swayed to and
fro, and the table quivered in his grasp. Presently,
however, as though arrested by a thought, he peered
out of the doorway toward Juniper Bend. &#8220;That
hawk seen him&mdash;it seen him. He&#8217;s comin&#8217;, I know it,
an&#8217; I&#8217;ll git him&mdash;plumb.&#8221; He had the mystery and
imagination of the mountain-dweller.</p>
<p>The rifle lay against the wall behind him, and he
turned and touched it almost caressingly. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t let
go like this since he was killed, Sinnet. It don&#8217;t do. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
got to keep myself stiddy to do the trick when the
minute comes. At first I usen&#8217;t to sleep at nights,
thinkin&#8217; of Clint, an&#8217; missin&#8217; him, an&#8217; I got shaky and
no good. So I put a cinch on myself, an&#8217; got to sleepin&#8217;
again&mdash;from the full dusk to dawn, for Greevy wouldn&#8217;t
take the trail at night. I&#8217;ve kept stiddy.&#8221; He held out
his hand as though to show that it was firm and steady,
but it trembled with the emotion which had conquered
him. He saw it, and shook his head angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was seein&#8217; you, Sinnet. It burst me. I ain&#8217;t
seen no one to speak to in a month, an&#8217; with you sittin&#8217;
there, it was like Clint an&#8217; me cuttin&#8217; and comin&#8217; again
off the loaf an&#8217; the knuckle-bone of ven&#8217;son.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinnet ran a long finger slowly across his lips, and
seemed meditating what he should say to the mountaineer.
At length he spoke, looking into Buckmaster&#8217;s
face: &#8220;What was the story Ricketts told you? What
did your boy tell Ricketts? I&#8217;ve heard, too, about it,
and that&#8217;s why I asked you if you had proofs that
Greevy killed Clint. Of course, Clint should know, and
if he told Ricketts, that&#8217;s pretty straight; but I&#8217;d like
to know if what I heard tallies with what Ricketts heard
from Clint. P&#8217;r&#8217;aps it&#8217;d ease your mind a bit to tell
it. I&#8217;ll watch the Bend&mdash;don&#8217;t you trouble about that.
You can&#8217;t do these two things at one time. I&#8217;ll watch
for Greevy; you give me Clint&#8217;s story to Ricketts. I
guess you know I&#8217;m feelin&#8217; for you, an&#8217; if I was in your
place I&#8217;d shoot the man that killed Clint, if it took ten
years. I&#8217;d have his heart&#8217;s blood&mdash;all of it. Whether
Greevy was in the right or in the wrong, I&#8217;d have him&mdash;<i>plumb</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buckmaster was moved. He gave a fierce exclamation
and made a gesture of cruelty. &#8220;Clint right or
wrong? There ain&#8217;t no question of that. My boy
wasn&#8217;t the kind to be in the wrong. What did he ever
do but what was right? If Clint was in the wrong I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
kill Greevy jest the same, for Greevy robbed him of all
the years that was before him&mdash;only a sapling he was,
an&#8217; all his growin&#8217; to do, all his branches to widen an&#8217;
his roots to spread. But that don&#8217;t enter in it, his bein&#8217;
in the wrong. It was a quarrel, and Clint never did
Greevy any harm. It was a quarrel over cards, an&#8217;
Greevy was drunk, an&#8217; followed Clint out into the
prairie in the night and shot him like a coyote. Clint
hadn&#8217;t no chance, an&#8217; he jest lay there on the ground
till morning, when Ricketts and Steve Joicey found
him. An&#8217; Clint told Ricketts who it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t Ricketts tell it right out at once?&#8221;
asked Sinnet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Greevy was his own cousin&mdash;it was in the family,
an&#8217; he kept thinkin&#8217; of Greevy&#8217;s gal, Em&#8217;ly. Her&mdash;what&#8217;ll
it matter to her? She&#8217;ll get married, an she&#8217;ll
forgit. I know her, a gal that&#8217;s got no deep feelin&#8217; like
Clint had for me. But because of her Ricketts didn&#8217;t
speak for a year. Then he couldn&#8217;t stand it any longer,
an&#8217; he told me&mdash;seein&#8217; how I suffered, an&#8217; everybody
hidin&#8217; their suspicions from me, an&#8217; me up here out o&#8217;
the way, an&#8217; no account. That was the feelin&#8217; among
&#8217;em: What was the good of making things worse? They
wasn&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; of the boy or of Jim Buckmaster, his
father. They was thinkin&#8217; of Greevy&#8217;s gal&mdash;to save
her trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinnet&#8217;s face was turned toward Juniper Bend, and
the eyes were fixed, as it were, on a still more distant
object&mdash;a dark, brooding, inscrutable look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that all Ricketts told you, Buck?&#8221; The voice
was very quiet, but it had a suggestive note.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all Clint told Bill before he died. That was
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause, and then, puffing out
long clouds of smoke, and in a tone of curious detachment,
as though he were telling something that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
saw now in the far distance, or as a spectator of a battle
from a far vantage-point might report to a blind man
standing near, Sinnet said:</p>
<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps Ricketts didn&#8217;t know the whole story;
p&#8217;r&#8217;aps Clint didn&#8217;t know it all to tell him; p&#8217;r&#8217;aps Clint
didn&#8217;t remember it all. P&#8217;r&#8217;aps he didn&#8217;t remember anything
except that he and Greevy quarrelled, and that
Greevy and he shot at each other in the prairie. He&#8217;d
only be thinking of the thing that mattered most to
him&mdash;that his life was over, an&#8217; that a man had put a
bullet in him, an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Buckmaster tried to interrupt him, but he waved a
hand impatiently, and continued: &#8220;As I say, maybe he
didn&#8217;t remember everything; he had been drinkin&#8217; a bit
himself, Clint had. He wasn&#8217;t used to liquor, and
couldn&#8217;t stand much. Greevy was drunk, too, and gone
off his head with rage. He always gets drunk when he
first comes south to spend the winter with his girl
Em&#8217;ly.&#8221; He paused a moment, then went on a little
more quickly. &#8220;Greevy was proud of her&mdash;couldn&#8217;t
even bear her being crossed in any way; and she has
a quick temper, and if she quarrelled with anybody
Greevy quarrelled too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know anything about her,&#8221; broke in
Buckmaster, roughly. &#8220;She isn&#8217;t in this thing. I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to get Greevy. I bin waitin&#8217; for him, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll git
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to kill the man that killed your boy,
if you can, Buck; but I&#8217;m telling my story in my own
way. You told Rickett&#8217;s story; I&#8217;ll tell what I&#8217;ve
heard. And before you kill Greevy you ought to know
all there is that anybody else knows&mdash;or suspicions
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know enough. Greevy done it, an&#8217; I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>
<p>With no apparent coherence and relevancy Sinnet
continued, but his voice was not so even as before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
&#8220;Em&#8217;ly was a girl that wasn&#8217;t twice alike. She was
changeable. First it was one, then it was another, and
she didn&#8217;t seem to be able to fix her mind. But that
didn&#8217;t prevent her leadin&#8217; men on. She wasn&#8217;t changeable,
though, about her father. She was to him what
your boy was to you. There she was like you, ready to
give everything up for her father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell y&#8217; I don&#8217;t want to hear about her,&#8221; said
Buckmaster, getting to his feet and setting his jaws.
&#8220;You needn&#8217;t talk to me about her. She&#8217;ll git over
it. I&#8217;ll never git over what Greevy done to me or to
Clint&mdash;jest twenty, jest twenty! I got my work to
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took his gun from the wall, slung it into the
hollow of his arm, and turned to look up the valley
through the open doorway.</p>
<p>The morning was sparkling with life&mdash;the life and
vigor which a touch of frost gives to the autumn world
in a country where the blood tingles to the dry, sweet
sting of the air. Beautiful, and spacious, and buoyant,
and lonely, the valley and the mountains seemed waiting,
like a new-born world, to be peopled by man. It
was as though all had been made ready for him&mdash;the
birds whistling and singing in the trees, the whisk of
the squirrels leaping from bough to bough, the peremptory
sound of the woodpecker&#8217;s beak against the
bole of a tree, the rustle of the leaves as a wood-hen
ran past&mdash;a waiting, virgin world.</p>
<p>Its beauty and its wonderful dignity had no appeal
to Buckmaster. His eyes and mind were fixed on a
deed which would stain the virgin wild with the ancient
crime that sent the first marauder on human life into
the wilderness.</p>
<p>As Buckmaster&#8217;s figure darkened the doorway Sinnet
seemed to waken as from a dream, and he got swiftly to
his feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
&#8220;Wait&mdash;you wait, Buck. You&#8217;ve got to hear all.
You haven&#8217;t heard my story yet. Wait, I tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was so sharp and insistent, so changed, that
Buckmaster turned from the doorway and came back
into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of my hearin&#8217;? You want me not to
kill Greevy, because of that gal. What&#8217;s she to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to you, Buck, but Clint was everything to
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mountaineer stood like one petrified.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that&mdash;what&#8217;s that you say? It&#8217;s a damn
lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t cards&mdash;the quarrel, not the real quarrel.
Greevy found Clint kissing her. Greevy wanted her
to marry Gatineau, the lumber-king. That was the
quarrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>A snarl was on the face of Buckmaster. &#8220;Then she&#8217;ll
not be sorry when I git him. It took Clint from her as
well as from me.&#8221; He turned to the door again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, wait, Buck, wait one minute and hear&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a low, exultant growl, and he
saw Buckmaster&#8217;s rifle clutched as a hunter, stooping,
clutches his gun to fire on his prey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, the spy-glass!&#8221; he flung back at Sinnet.
&#8220;It&#8217;s him, but I&#8217;ll make sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinnet caught the telescope from the nails where it
hung, and looked out toward Juniper Bend. &#8220;It&#8217;s
Greevy&mdash;and his girl, and the half-breeds,&#8221; he said,
with a note in his voice that almost seemed agitation,
and yet few had ever seen Sinnet agitated. &#8220;Em&#8217;ly
must have gone up the trail in the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my turn now,&#8221; the mountaineer said, hoarsely,
and, stooping, slid away quickly into the undergrowth.</p>
<p>Sinnet followed, keeping near him, neither speaking.
For a half mile they hastened on, and now and then
Buckmaster drew aside the bushes, and looked up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
valley, to keep Greevy and his <i>bois brûlées</i> in his eye.
Just so had he and his son and Sinnet stalked the
wapiti and the red deer along these mountains; but
this was a man that Buckmaster was stalking now, with
none of the joy of the sport which had been his since
a lad; only the malice of the avenger. The lust of a
mountain feud was on him; he was pursuing the price
of blood.</p>
<p>At last Buckmaster stopped at a ledge of rock just
above the trail. Greevy would pass below, within three
hundred yards of his rifle. He turned to Sinnet with
cold and savage eyes. &#8220;You go back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
my business. I don&#8217;t want you to see. You don&#8217;t
want to see, then you won&#8217;t know, and you won&#8217;t need
to lie. You said that the man that killed Clint ought
to die. He&#8217;s going to die, but it&#8217;s none o&#8217; your business.
I want to be alone. In a minute he&#8217;ll be where I kin
git him&mdash;plumb. You go, Sinnet&mdash;right off. It&#8217;s my
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a strange, desperate look in Sinnet&#8217;s face;
it was as hard as stone, but his eyes had a light of
battle in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my business right enough, Buck,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
you&#8217;re not going to kill Greevy. That girl of his has
lost her lover, your boy. It&#8217;s broke her heart almost,
and there&#8217;s no use making her an orphan too. She
can&#8217;t stand it. She&#8217;s had enough. You leave her father
alone&mdash;you hear me, let up!&#8221; He stepped between
Buckmaster and the ledge of rock from which the
mountaineer was to take aim.</p>
<p>There was a terrible look in Buckmaster&#8217;s face. He
raised his single-barrelled rifle, as though he would shoot
Sinnet; but, at the moment, he remembered that a
shot would warn Greevy, and that he might not have
time to reload. He laid his rifle against a tree swiftly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git away from here,&#8221; he said, with a strange rattle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
in his throat. &#8220;Git away quick; he&#8217;ll be down past
here in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinnet pulled himself together as he saw Buckmaster
snatch at a great clasp-knife in his belt. He jumped
and caught Buckmaster&#8217;s wrist in a grip like a vise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Greevy didn&#8217;t kill him, Buck,&#8221; he said. But the
mountaineer was gone mad, and did not grasp the
meaning of the words. He twined his left arm round
the neck of Sinnet, and the struggle began, he fighting
to free Sinnet&#8217;s hand from his wrist, to break Sinnet&#8217;s
neck. He did not realize what he was doing. He only
knew that this man stood between him and the murderer
of his boy, and all the ancient forces of barbarism
were alive in him. Little by little they drew to the
edge of the rock, from which there was a sheer drop
of two hundred feet. Sinnet fought like a panther for
safety, but no sane man&#8217;s strength could withstand
the demoniacal energy that bent and crushed him.
Sinnet felt his strength giving. Then he said,
in a hoarse whisper: &#8220;Greevy didn&#8217;t kill him. I killed him,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment he was borne to the ground with a
hand on his throat, and an instant after the knife went
home.</p>
<p>Buckmaster got to his feet and looked at his victim
for an instant, dazed and wild; then he sprang for his
gun. As he did so the words that Sinnet had said as
they struggled rang in his ears, &#8220;<i>Greevy didn&#8217;t kill him;
I killed him</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave a low cry and turned back toward Sinnet,
who lay in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>Sinnet was speaking. He went and stooped over
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Em&#8217;ly threw me over for Clint,&#8221; the voice said,
huskily, &#8220;and I followed to have it out with Clint. So
did Greevy, but Greevy was drunk. I saw them meet.
I was hid. I saw that Clint would kill Greevy, and I
fired. I was off my head&mdash;I&#8217;d never cared for any
woman before, and Greevy was her father. Clint was
off his head too. He had called me names that day&mdash;a
cardsharp, and a liar, and a thief, and a skunk, he called
me, and I hated him just then. Greevy fired twice&mdash;wide.
He didn&#8217;t know but what he killed Clint, but he
didn&#8217;t. I did. So I tried to stop you, Buck&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Life was going fast, and speech failed him; but he
opened his eyes again and whispered: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to
die, Buck. I am only thirty-five, and it&#8217;s too soon; but
it had to be. Don&#8217;t look that way, Buck. You got
the man that killed him&mdash;plumb. But Em&#8217;ly didn&#8217;t
play fair with me&mdash;made a fool of me, the only time in
my life I ever cared for a woman. You leave Greevy
alone, Buck, and tell Em&#8217;ly for me I wouldn&#8217;t let you
kill her father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;Sinnet&mdash;you, you done it! Why, he&#8217;d have
fought for you. You&mdash;done it&mdash;to him&mdash;to Clint!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the blood-feud had been satisfied, a great
change came over the mountaineer. He had done his
work, and the thirst for vengeance was gone. Greevy
he had hated, but this man had been with him in many
a winter&#8217;s hunt. His brain could hardly grasp the
tragedy&mdash;it had all been too sudden.</p>
<p>Suddenly he stooped down. &#8220;Sinnet,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ef
there was a woman in it, that makes all the difference.
Sinnet, ef&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sinnet was gone upon a long trail that led into
an illimitable wilderness. With a moan the old man
ran to the ledge of rock. Greevy and his girl were below.</p>
<p>&#8220;When there&#8217;s a woman in it&mdash;!&#8221; he said, in a voice
of helplessness and misery, and watched her till she
disappeared from view. Then he turned, and, lifting
up in his arms the man he had killed, carried him into
the deeper woods.</p>

<h2>TO-MORROW</h2>
</div>

<div class='ce'>
<p>I</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;My, nothing&#8217;s the matter with the world to-day!
It&#8217;s so good it almost hurts.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her head from the white petticoat she was
ironing, and gazed out of the doorway and down the
valley with a warm light in her eyes and a glowing face.
The snow-tipped mountains far above and away, the
fir-covered, cedar-ranged foothills, and, lower down,
the wonderful maple and ash woods, with their hundred
autumn tints, all merging to one soft, red tone, the roar
of the stream tumbling down the ravine from the
heights, the air that braced the nerves like wine&mdash;it all
seemed to be part of her, the passion of life corresponding
to the passion of living in her.</p>
<p>After watching the scene dreamily for a moment, she
turned and laid the iron she had been using upon the
hot stove near. Taking up another, she touched it with
a moistened finger to test the heat, and, leaning above
the table again, passed it over the linen for a few moments,
smiling at something that was in her mind.
Presently she held the petticoat up, turned it round,
then hung it in front of her, eying it with critical
pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>To-morrow!</i>&#8221; she said, nodding at it. &#8220;You won&#8217;t
be seen, I suppose, but <i>I&#8217;ll</i> know you&#8217;re nice enough
for a queen&mdash;and that&#8217;s enough to know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
She blushed a little, as though some one had heard
her words and was looking at her, then she carefully
laid the petticoat over the back of a chair. &#8220;No
queen&#8217;s got one whiter, if I do say it,&#8221; she continued,
tossing her head.</p>
<p>In that, at any rate, she was right, for the water of
the mountain springs was pure, the air was clear, and
the sun was clarifying; and little ornamented or frilled
as it was, the petticoat was exquisitely soft and delicate.
It would have appealed to more eyes than a woman&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow!&#8221; She nodded at it again and turned
again to the bright world outside. With arms raised
and hands resting against the timbers of the doorway,
she stood dreaming. A flock of pigeons passed with
a whir not far away, and skirted the woods making
down the valley. She watched their flight abstractedly,
yet with a subconscious sense of pleasure. Life&mdash;they
were Life, eager, buoyant, belonging to this wild region,
where still the heart could feel so much at home, where
the great world was missed so little.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as she gazed, a shot rang out down the
valley, and two of the pigeons came tumbling to the
ground, a stray feather floating after. With a startled
exclamation she took a step forward. Her brain became
confused and disturbed. She had looked out on
Eden, and it had been ravaged before her eyes. She
had been thinking of to-morrow, and this vast prospect
of beauty and serenity had been part of the pageant in
which it moved. Not the valley alone had been marauded,
but that &#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; and all it meant to her.</p>
<p>Instantly the valley had become clouded over for
her, its glory and its grace despoiled. She turned back
to the room where the white petticoat lay upon the
chair, but stopped with a little cry of alarm.</p>
<p>A man was standing in the centre of the room. He
had entered stealthily by the back door, and had waited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
for her to turn round. He was haggard and travel-stained,
and there was a feverish light in his eyes. His
fingers trembled as they adjusted his belt, which seemed
too large for him. Mechanically he buckled it tighter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Jenny Long, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I beg
pardon for sneakin&#8217; in like this, but they&#8217;re after me,
some ranchers and a constable&mdash;one o&#8217; the Riders of
the Plains. I&#8217;ve been tryin&#8217; to make this house all day.
You&#8217;re Jenny Long, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had plenty of courage, and, after the first instant
of shock, she had herself in hand. She had quickly
observed his condition, had marked the candor of the
eye and the decision and character of the face, and
doubt of him found no place in her mind. She had the
keen observation of the dweller in lonely places, where
every traveller has the potentialities of a foe, while the
door of hospitality is opened to him after the custom of
the wilds. Year in, year out, since she was a little girl
and came to live here with her Uncle Sanger when her
father died&mdash;her mother had gone before she could
speak&mdash;travellers had halted at this door, going North
or coming South, had had bite and sup, and bed, maybe,
and had passed on, most of them never to be seen again.
More than that, too, there had been moments of peril,
such as when, alone, she had faced two wood-thieves
with a revolver, as they were taking her mountain-pony
with them, and herself had made them &#8220;hands-up,&#8221;
and had marched them into a prospector&#8217;s camp
five miles away.</p>
<p>She had no doubt about the man before her. Whatever
he had done, it was nothing dirty or mean&mdash;of that
she was sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m Jenny Long,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;What have
you done? What are they after you for?&#8221;</p>

&#8220;THEY SHOT ME AN&#8217; HURT ME&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;Oh! to-morrow,&#8221; he answered&mdash;&#8220;to-morrow I got
to git to Bindon. It&#8217;s life or death. I come from prospecting
two hundred miles up North. I done it in two
days and a half. My horse dropped dead&mdash;I&#8217;m near
dead myself. I tried to borrow another horse up at
Clancey&#8217;s, and at Scotton&#8217;s Drive, but they didn&#8217;t know
me, and they bounced me. So I borrowed a horse off
Weigall&#8217;s paddock, to make for here&mdash;to you. I didn&#8217;t
mean to keep that horse. Hell, I&#8217;m no horse-stealer!
But I couldn&#8217;t explain to them, except that I had to git
to Bindon to save a man&#8217;s life. If people laugh in your
face, it&#8217;s no use explainin&#8217;. I took a roan from Weigall&#8217;s,
and they got after me. &#8217;Bout six miles up they shot at
me an&#8217; hurt me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw that one arm hung limp at his side and that
his wrist was wound with a red bandana.</p>
<p>She started forward. &#8220;Are you hurt bad? Can I
bind it up or wash it for you? I&#8217;ve got plenty of hot
water here, and it&#8217;s bad letting a wound get stale.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;I washed the hole clean in the
creek below. I doubled on them. I had to go down
past your place here, and then work back to be rid of
them. But there&#8217;s no telling when they&#8217;ll drop onto
the game, and come back for me. My only chance was
to git to you. Even if I had a horse, I couldn&#8217;t make
Bindon in time. It&#8217;s two days round the gorge by
trail. A horse is no use now&mdash;I lost too much time since
last night. I can&#8217;t git to Bindon to-morrow in time, if
I ride the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The river?&#8221; she asked, abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only way. It cuts off fifty mile. That&#8217;s
why I come to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She frowned a little, her face became troubled, and
her glance fell on his arm nervously. &#8220;What&#8217;ve I got
to do with it?&#8221; she asked, almost sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if this was all right&#8221;&mdash;he touched the wounded
arm&mdash;&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t take the rapids in a canoe. I don&#8217;t
know them, an&#8217; it would be sure death. That&#8217;s not the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
worst, for there&#8217;s a man at Bindon would lose his life&mdash;p&#8217;r&#8217;aps
twenty men&mdash;I dunno; but one man sure. To-morrow,
it&#8217;s go or stay with him. He was good&mdash;Lord,
but he was good!&mdash;to my little gal years back. She&#8217;d
only been married to me a year when he saved her,
riskin&#8217; his own life. No one else had the pluck. My
little gal, only twenty she was, an&#8217; pretty as a picture,
an&#8217; me fifty miles away when the fire broke out in the
hotel where she was. He&#8217;d have gone down to hell for
a friend, an&#8217; he saved my little gal. I had her for five
years after that. That&#8217;s why I got to git to Bindon
to-morrow. If I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t want to see to-morrow.
I got to go down the river to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She knew what he was going to ask her. She knew
he was thinking what all the North knew, that she was
the first person to take the Dog Nose Rapids in a canoe,
down the great river scarce a stone&#8217;s-throw from her
door; and that she had done it in safety many times.
Not in all the West and North were there a half dozen
people who could take a canoe to Bindon, and they
were not here. She knew that he meant to ask her
to paddle him down the swift stream, with its murderous
rocks, to Bindon. She glanced at the white petticoat
on the chair, and her lips tightened. To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow
was as much to her here as it would be to
this man before her, or the man he would save at
Bindon.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; she asked, hardening her
heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see? I want you to hide me here till
to-night. There&#8217;s a full moon, an&#8217; it would be as plain
goin&#8217; as by day. They told me about you up North,
and I said to myself, &#8216;If I git to Jenny Long, an&#8217; tell
her about my friend at Bindon, an&#8217; my little gal, she&#8217;ll
take me down to Bindon in time.&#8217; My little gal would
have paid her own debt if she&#8217;d ever had the chance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
She didn&#8217;t&mdash;she&#8217;s lying up on Mazy Mountain. But
one woman&#8217;ll do a lot for the sake of another woman.
Say, you&#8217;ll do it, won&#8217;t you? If I don&#8217;t git there by
to-morrow noon, it&#8217;s no good.&#8221;</p>
<p>She would not answer. He was asking more than
he knew. Why should she be sacrificed? Was it her
duty to pay the &#8220;little gal&#8217;s debt,&#8221; to save the man at
Bindon? To-morrow was to be the great day in her
own life. The one man in all the world was coming to
marry her to-morrow. After four years&#8217; waiting, after
a bitter quarrel in which both had been to blame, he
was coming from the mining town of Selby to marry
her to-morrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will happen? Why will your friend lose his
life if you don&#8217;t get to Bindon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By noon to-morrow, by twelve o&#8217;clock noon; that&#8217;s
the plot; that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve schemed. Three days
ago, I heard. I got a man free from trouble North&mdash;he
was no good, but I thought he ought to have another
chance, and I got him free. He told me of what was
to be done at Bindon. There&#8217;d been a strike in the
mine, an&#8217; my friend had took it in hand with knuckle-dusters
on. He isn&#8217;t the kind to fell a tree with a jack-knife.
Then three of the strikers that had been turned
away&mdash;they was the ringleaders&mdash;they laid a plan that&#8217;d
make the devil sick. They&#8217;ve put a machine in the
mine, an&#8217; timed it, an&#8217; it&#8217;ll go off when my friend comes
out of the mine at noon to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was pale now, and her eyes had a look of
pain and horror. Her man&mdash;him that she was to marry&mdash;was
the head of a mine also at Selby, forty miles
beyond Bindon, and the horrible plot came home to
her with piercing significance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a second&#8217;s warning,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;to go like
that, the man that was so good to my little gal, an&#8217; me
with a chance to save him, an&#8217; others too, p&#8217;r&#8217;aps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
You won&#8217;t let it be. Say, I&#8217;m pinnin&#8217; my faith to you.
I&#8217;m&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly he swayed. She caught him, held him, and
lowered him gently in a chair. Presently he opened
his eyes. &#8220;It&#8217;s want o&#8217; food, I suppose,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
you&#8217;ve got a bit of bread and meat&mdash;I must keep up.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went to a cupboard, but suddenly turned toward
him again. Her ears had caught a sound outside in the
underbrush. He had heard also, and he half staggered
to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick&mdash;in here!&#8221; she said, and, opening a door,
pushed him inside. &#8220;Lie down on my bed, and I&#8217;ll
bring you vittles as quick as I can,&#8221; she added. Then
she shut the door, turned to the ironing-board, and took
up the iron, as the figure of a man darkened the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Jinny, fixin&#8217; up for to-morrow?&#8221; the man
said, stepping inside, with a rifle under his arm and
some pigeons in his hand.</p>
<p>She nodded and gave him an impatient, scrutinizing
glance. His face had a fatuous kind of smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been celebrating the pigeons?&#8221; she asked, dryly,
jerking her head toward the two birds, which she had
seen drop from her Eden skies a short time before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only had one swig of whiskey, honest Injun!&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;I s&#8217;pose I might have waited till to-morrow,
but I was dead-beat. I got a bear over by the Ten-mile
Reach, and I was tired. I ain&#8217;t so young as I used
to be, and, anyhow, what&#8217;s the good? What&#8217;s ahead of
me? You&#8217;re going to git married to-morrow after all
these years we bin together, and you&#8217;re going down to
Selby from the mountains, where I won&#8217;t see you, not
once in a blue moon. Only that old trollop, Mother
Massy, to look after me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down to Selby and live there. You&#8217;ll be
welcome by Jake and me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>He stood his gun in the corner and, swinging the
pigeons in his hand, said: &#8220;Me live out of the mountains!
Don&#8217;t you know better than that? I couldn&#8217;t
breathe, and I wouldn&#8217;t want to breathe. I&#8217;ve got
my shack here, I got my fur business, and they&#8217;re still
fond of whiskey up North!&#8221; He chuckled to himself,
as he thought of the illicit still farther up the mountain
behind them. &#8220;I make enough to live on, and I&#8217;ve put
a few dollars by, though I won&#8217;t have so many after
to-morrow, after I&#8217;ve given you a little pile, Jinny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps there won&#8217;t be any <i>to-morrow</i>, as you expect,&#8221;
she said, slowly.</p>
<p>The old man started. &#8220;What! you and Jake ain&#8217;t
quarrelled again? You ain&#8217;t broke it off at the last
moment, same as before? You ain&#8217;t had a letter from
Jake?&#8221; He looked at the white petticoat on the chair-back,
and shook his head in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had no letter,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had no
letter from Selby for a month. It was all settled then,
and there was no good writing, when he was coming
to-morrow with the minister and the license. Who do
you think&#8217;d be postman from Selby here? It must
have cost him ten dollars to send the last letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s the matter? I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; the
old man urged, querulously. He did not want her to
marry and leave him, but he wanted no more troubles;
he did not relish being asked awkward questions by
every mountaineer he met as to why Jenny Long didn&#8217;t
marry Jake Lawson.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one way that I can be married to-morrow,&#8221;
she said, at last, &#8220;and that&#8217;s by you taking
a man down the Dog Nose Rapids to Bindon to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dropped the pigeons on the floor, dumfounded.
&#8220;What in&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped short, in sheer incapacity to go further.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Jenny had not always been easy to understand, but she
was wholly incomprehensible now.</p>
<p>She picked up the pigeons and was about to speak,
but she glanced at the bedroom door, where her exhausted
visitor had stretched himself on her bed, and
beckoned her uncle to another room.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a plate of vittles ready for you in there,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you as you eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>He followed her into the little living-room adorned
by the trophies of his earlier achievements with gun and
rifle, and sat down at the table, where some food lay
covered by a clean white cloth.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one&#8217;ll ever look after me as you&#8217;ve done, Jinny,&#8221;
he said, as he lifted the cloth and saw the palatable
dish ready for him. Then he remembered again about
to-morrow and the Dog Nose Rapids.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it all about, Jinny? What&#8217;s that about my
canoeing a man down to Bindon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat, uncle,&#8221; she said, more softly than she had yet
spoken, for his words about her care of him had brought
a moisture to her eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in a minute and
tell you all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s about took away my appetite,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I feel a kind of sinking.&#8221; He took from his pocket
a bottle, poured some of its contents into a tin cup, and
drank it off.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I suppose you couldn&#8217;t take a man down to
Bindon,&#8221; she said, as she saw his hand trembling on
the cup. Then she turned and entered the other room
again. Going to the cupboard, she hastily heaped a
plate with food, and, taking a dipper of water from a
pail near by, she entered her bedroom hastily and
placed what she had brought on a small table, as her
visitor rose slowly from the bed.</p>
<p>He was about to speak, but she made a protesting
gesture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you anything yet,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it come?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;My uncle&mdash;I&#8217;m going to tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The men after me may git here any minute,&#8221; he
urged, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d not be coming into my room,&#8221; she answered,
flushing slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you hide me down by the river till we start?&#8221;
he asked, his eyes eagerly searching her face. He was
assuming that she would take him down the river; but
she gave no sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to see if he&#8217;ll take you first?&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&mdash;your uncle, Tom Sanger? He drinks, I&#8217;ve
heard. He&#8217;d never git to Bindon.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not reply directly to his words. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come
back and tell you. There&#8217;s a place you could hide by
the river where no one could ever find you,&#8221; she said,
and left the room.</p>
<p>As she stepped out, she saw the old man standing in
the doorway of the other room. His face was petrified
with amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who you got in that room, Jinny? What man you
got in that room? I heard a man&#8217;s voice. Is it because
o&#8217; him that you bin talkin&#8217; about no weddin&#8217;
to-morrow? Is it one o&#8217; the others come back, puttin&#8217;
you off Jake again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed fire at his first words, and her breast
heaved with anger, but suddenly she became composed
again and motioned him to a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You eat, and I&#8217;ll tell you all about it, Uncle Tom,&#8221;
she said, and, seating herself at the table also, she told
him the story of the man who must go to Bindon.</p>
<p>When she had finished, the old man blinked at her
for a minute without speaking, then he said, slowly: &#8220;I
heard something &#8217;bout trouble down at Bindon yisterday
from a Hudson&#8217;s Bay man goin&#8217; North, but I didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
take it in. You&#8217;ve got a lot o&#8217; sense, Jinny, an&#8217; if you
think he&#8217;s tellin&#8217; the truth, why, it goes; but it&#8217;s as big
a mixup as a lariat in a steer&#8217;s horns. You&#8217;ve got to
hide him sure, whoever he is, for I wouldn&#8217;t hand an
Eskimo over, if I&#8217;d taken him in my home once; we&#8217;re
mountain people. A man ought to be hung for horse-stealin&#8217;,
but this was different. He was doing it to
save a man&#8217;s life, an&#8217; that man at Bindon was good to
his little gal, an&#8217; she&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved his head from side to side with the air of
a sentimental philosopher. He had all the vanity of a
man who had been a success in a small, shrewd, culpable
way&mdash;had he not evaded the law for thirty years with
his whiskey-still?</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how he felt,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;When Betsy
died&mdash;we was only four years married&mdash;I could have
crawled into a knot-hole an&#8217; died there. You got to
save him, Jinny, but&#8221;&mdash;he came suddenly to his feet&mdash;&#8220;he
ain&#8217;t safe here. They might come any minute, if
they&#8217;ve got back on his trail. I&#8217;ll take him up the
gorge. You know where.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sit still, Uncle Tom,&#8221; she rejoined. &#8220;Leave
him where he is a minute. There&#8217;s things must be
settled first. They ain&#8217;t going to look for him in my
bedroom, be they?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man chuckled. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see &#8217;em at it.
You got a temper, Jinny; and you got a pistol, too,
eh?&#8221; He chuckled again. &#8220;As good a shot as any in
the mountains. I can see you darin&#8217; &#8217;em to come on.
But what if Jake come, and he found a man in your
bedroom&#8221;&mdash;he wiped the tears of laughter from his
eyes&mdash;&#8220;why, Jinny&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped short, for there was anger in her face.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear any more of that. I do what
I want to do,&#8221; she snapped out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, you always done what you wanted; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
we got to git him up the hills, till it&#8217;s sure they&#8217;re out o&#8217;
the mountains and gone back. It&#8217;ll be days, mebbe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom, you&#8217;ve took too much to drink,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;You don&#8217;t remember he&#8217;s got to be at
Bindon by to-morrow noon. He&#8217;s got to save his friend
by then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw! Who&#8217;s going to take him down the river
to-night? You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to be married to-morrow. If
you like, you can give him the canoe. It&#8217;ll never come
back, nor him neither!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been down with me,&#8221; she responded, suggestively.
&#8220;And you went down once by yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t been so well this summer.
My sight ain&#8217;t what it was. I can&#8217;t stand the
racket as I once could. &#8217;Pears to me I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; old.
No, I couldn&#8217;t take them rapids, Jinny, not for one
frozen minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him with trouble in her eyes, and her
face lost some of its color. She was fighting back the
inevitable, even as its shadow fell upon her. &#8220;You
wouldn&#8217;t want a man to die, if you could save him,
Uncle Tom&mdash;blown up, sent to Kingdom Come without
any warning at all; and perhaps he&#8217;s got them
that love him&mdash;and the world so beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it ain&#8217;t nice dyin&#8217; in the summer, when it&#8217;s
all sun, and there&#8217;s plenty everywhere; but there&#8217;s
no one to go down the river with him. What&#8217;s his
name?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her struggle was over. She had urged him, but in
very truth she was urging herself all the time, bringing
herself to the axe of sacrifice.</p>
<p>&#8220;His name&#8217;s Dingley. I&#8217;m going down the river
with him&mdash;down to Bindon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man&#8217;s mouth opened in blank amazement.
His eyes blinked helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you talkin&#8217; about, Jinny? Jake&#8217;s comin&#8217; up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
with the minister, an&#8217; you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to be married at noon
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m takin&#8217; him&#8221;&mdash;she jerked her head toward the
room where Dingley was&mdash;&#8220;down Dog Nose Rapids
to-night. He&#8217;s risked his life for his friend, thinkin&#8217; of
her that&#8217;s dead an&#8217; gone, and a man&#8217;s life is a man&#8217;s life.
If it was Jake&#8217;s life in danger, what &#8217;d I think of a
woman that could save him, and didn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Onct you broke off with Jake Lawson&mdash;the day before
you was to be married; an&#8217; it&#8217;s took years to make
up an&#8217; agree again to be spliced. If Jake comes here
to-morrow, and you ain&#8217;t here, what do you think he&#8217;ll
do? The neighbors are comin&#8217; for fifty miles round,
two is comin&#8217; up a hundred miles, and you can&#8217;t&mdash;Jinny,
you can&#8217;t do it. I bin sick of answerin&#8217; questions all
these years &#8217;bout you and Jake, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; through
it again. I&#8217;ve told more lies than there&#8217;s straws in a
tick.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flamed out. &#8220;Then take him down the river
yourself&mdash;a man to do a man&#8217;s work. Are you afeard
to take the risk?&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out his hands slowly and looked at them.
They shook a little. &#8220;Yes, Jinny,&#8221; he said, sadly, &#8220;I&#8217;m
afeard. I ain&#8217;t what I was. I made a mistake, Jinny.
I&#8217;ve took too much whiskey. I&#8217;m older than I ought to
be. I oughtn&#8217;t never to have had a whiskey-still, an&#8217; I
wouldn&#8217;t have drunk so much. I got money&mdash;money
for you, Jinny, for you an&#8217; Jake, but I&#8217;ve lost what I&#8217;ll
never git back. I&#8217;m afeard to go down the river with
him. I&#8217;d go smash in the Dog Nose Rapids. I got no
nerve. I can&#8217;t hunt the grizzly any more, nor the
puma, Jinny. I got to keep to common shootin&#8217;, now
and henceforth, amen! No, I&#8217;d go smash in Dog Nose
Rapids.&#8221;</p>
<p>She caught his hands impulsively. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret,
Uncle Tom. You&#8217;ve bin a good uncle to me, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
you&#8217;ve bin a good friend, and you ain&#8217;t the first that&#8217;s
found whiskey too much for him. You ain&#8217;t got an
enemy in the mountains. Why, I&#8217;ve got two or three&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! Women&mdash;only women whose beaux left
&#8217;em to follow after you. That&#8217;s nothing, an&#8217; they&#8217;ll
be your friends fast enough after you&#8217;re married to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t going to be married to-morrow. I&#8217;m going
down to Bindon to-night. If Jake&#8217;s mad, then it&#8217;s all
over, and there&#8217;ll be more trouble among the women up
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time they had entered the other room. The
old man saw the white petticoat on the chair. &#8220;No
woman in the mountains ever had a petticoat like that,
Jinny. It&#8217;d make a dress, it&#8217;s that pretty an&#8217; neat.
Golly! I&#8217;d like to see it on you, with the blue skirt over,
and just hitched up a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up&mdash;shut up!&#8221; she said, in sudden anger,
and caught up the petticoat as though she would put
it away; but presently she laid it down again and
smoothed it with quick, nervous fingers. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you
talk sense and leave my clothes alone? If Jake comes,
and I&#8217;m not here, and he wants to make a fuss, and
spoil everything, and won&#8217;t wait, you give him this
petticoat. You put it in his arms. I bet you&#8217;ll have
the laugh on him. He&#8217;s got a temper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8217;ve you, Jinny, dear, so&#8217;ve you,&#8221; said the old
man, laughing. &#8220;You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to have your own way,
same as ever&mdash;same as ever.&#8221;</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>II</p>
</div>

<p>A moon of exquisite whiteness silvering the world,
making shadows on the water as though it were sunlight
and the daytime, giving a spectral look to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
endless array of poplar trees on the banks, glittering on
the foam of the rapids. The spangling stars made the
arch of the sky like some gorgeous chancel in a cathedral
as vast as life and time. Like the day which was
ended, in which the mountain-girl had found a taste of
Eden, it seemed too sacred for mortal strife. Now and
again there came the note of a night-bird, the croak of
a frog from the shore; but the serene stillness and
beauty of the primeval North was over all.</p>
<p>For two hours after sunset it had all been silent and
brooding, and then two figures appeared on the bank
of the great river. A canoe was softly and hastily
pushed out from its hidden shelter under the overhanging
bank, and was noiselessly paddled out to mid-stream,
dropping down the current meanwhile.</p>
<p>It was Jenny Long and the man who must get to
Bindon. They had waited till nine o&#8217;clock, when the
moon was high and full, to venture forth. Then Dingley
had dropped from her bedroom window, had joined
her under the trees, and they had sped away, while the
man&#8217;s hunters, who had come suddenly, and before
Jenny could get him away into the woods, were carousing
inside. These had tracked their man back to Tom
Sanger&#8217;s house, and at first they were incredulous that
Jenny and her uncle had not seen him. They had prepared
to search the house, and one had laid his finger
on the latch of her bedroom door; but she had flared
out with such anger that, mindful of the supper she had
already begun to prepare for them, they had desisted,
and the whiskey-jug which the old man brought out distracted
their attention.</p>
<p>One of their number, known as the Man from Clancey&#8217;s
had, however, been outside when Dingley had dropped
from the window, and had seen him from a distance.
He had not given the alarm, but had followed, to make
the capture by himself. But Jenny had heard the stir
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
of life behind them, and had made a sharp détour, so
that they had reached the shore and were out in mid-stream
before their tracker got to the river. Then he
called to them to return, but Jenny only bent a little
lower and paddled on, guiding the canoe toward the safe-channel
through the first small rapids leading to the
great Dog Nose Rapids.</p>
<p>A rifle-shot rang out, and a bullet &#8220;pinged&#8221; over the
water and splintered the side of the canoe where Dingley
sat. He looked calmly back, and saw the rifle raised
again, but did not stir, in spite of Jenny&#8217;s warning to
lie down.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll not fire on you so long as he can draw a bead
on me,&#8221; he said, quietly.</p>
<p>Again a shot rang out, and the bullet sang past his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he hits me, you go straight on to Bindon,&#8221; he
continued. &#8220;Never mind about me. Go to the Snowdrop
Mine. Get there by twelve o&#8217;clock, and warn
them. Don&#8217;t stop a second for me&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly three shots rang out in succession&mdash;Tom
Sanger&#8217;s house had emptied itself on the bank of the
river&mdash;and Dingley gave a sharp exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve hit me, but it&#8217;s the same arm as before,&#8221;
he growled. &#8220;They got no right to fire at me. It&#8217;s not
the law. Don&#8217;t stop,&#8221; he added, quickly, as he saw her
half turn round.</p>
<p>Now there were loud voices on the shore. Old Tom
Sanger was threatening to shoot the first man that
fired again, and he would have kept his word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who you firin&#8217; at?&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;That&#8217;s my
niece, Jinny Long, an&#8217; you let that boat alone. This
ain&#8217;t the land o&#8217; lynch law. Dingley ain&#8217;t escaped from
gaol. You got no right to fire at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one ever went down Dog Nose Rapids at night,&#8221;
said the Man from Clancey&#8217;s, whose shot had got Dingley&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
arm. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t a chance of them doing it. No
one&#8217;s ever done it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two were in the roaring rapids now, and the
canoe was jumping through the foam like a race-horse.
The keen eyes on the bank watched the canoe till it
was lost in the half-gloom below the first rapids, and
then they went slowly back to Tom Sanger&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>&#8220;So there&#8217;ll be no wedding to-morrow,&#8221; said the Man
from Clancey&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funerals, more likely,&#8221; drawled another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jinny Long&#8217;s in that canoe, an&#8217; she ginerally does
what she wants to,&#8221; said Tom Sanger, sagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we done our best, and now I hope they&#8217;ll get
to Bindon,&#8221; said another.</p>
<p>Sanger passed the jug to him freely. Then they sat
down and talked of the people who had been drowned
in Dog Nose Rapids, and of the last wedding in the
mountains.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>III</p>
</div>

<p>It was as the Man from Clancey&#8217;s had said, no one had
ever gone down Dog Nose Rapids in the night-time,
and probably no one but Jenny Long would have ventured
it. Dingley had had no idea what a perilous task
had been set his rescuer. It was only when the angry
roar of the great rapids floated up-stream to them, increasing
in volume till they could see the terror of
tumbling waters just below, and the canoe shot forward
like a snake through the swift, smooth current which
would sweep them into the vast caldron, that he realized
the terrible hazard of the enterprise.</p>
<p>The moon was directly overhead when they drew
upon the race of rocks and fighting water and foam.
On either side only the shadowed shore, forsaken by
the races which had hunted and roamed and ravaged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
here&mdash;not a light, nor any sign of life, or the friendliness
of human presence to make their isolation less complete,
their danger, as it were, shared by fellow-mortals.
Bright as the moon was, it was not bright enough for
perfect pilotage. Never in the history of white men
had these rapids been ridden at night-time. As they
sped down the flume of the deep, irresistible current,
and were launched into the trouble of rocks and water,
Jenny realized how great their peril was, and how different
the track of the waters looked at night-time from
daytime. Outlines seemed merged, rocks did not look
the same, whirlpools had a different vortex, islands of
stone had a new configuration. As they sped on, lurching,
jumping, piercing a broken wall of wave and spray
like a torpedo, shooting an almost sheer fall, she came
to rely on a sense of intuition rather than memory, for
night had transformed the waters.</p>
<p>Not a sound escaped either. The man kept his eyes
fixed on the woman; the woman scanned the dreadful
pathway with eyes deep-set and burning, resolute,
vigilant, and yet defiant, too, as though she had been
trapped into this track of danger, and was fighting without
great hope, but with the temerity and nonchalance
of despair. Her arms were bare to the shoulder almost,
and her face was again and again drenched, but second
succeeded second, minute followed minute in a struggle
which might well turn a man&#8217;s hair gray, and now, at
last&mdash;how many hours was it since they had been cast
into this den of roaring waters?&mdash;at last, suddenly, over
a large fall, and here smooth waters again, smooth and
untroubled, and strong and deep. Then, and only then,
did a word escape either; but the man had passed
through torture and unavailing regret, for he realized
that he had had no right to bring this girl into such a
fight. It was not <i>her</i> friend who was in danger at Bindon.
Her life had been risked without due warrant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know, or I wouldn&#8217;t have asked it,&#8221; he said,
in a low voice. &#8220;Lord, but you are a wonder&mdash;to take
that hurdle for no one that belonged to you, and to do
it as you&#8217;ve done it. This country will rise to you.&#8221;
He looked back on the raging rapids far behind, and
he shuddered. &#8220;It was a close call, and no mistake.
We must have been within a foot of down-you-go fifty
times. But it&#8217;s all right now, if we can last it out and
git there.&#8221; Again he glanced back, then turned to the
girl. &#8220;It makes me pretty sick to look at it,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;I bin through a lot, but that&#8217;s as sharp practice
as I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here and let me bind up your arm,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;They hit you&mdash;the sneaks! Are you bleeding
much?&#8221;</p>
<p>He came near her carefully, as she got the big canoe
out of the current into quieter water. She whipped the
scarf from about her neck, and with his knife ripped up
the seam of his sleeve. Her face was alive with the
joy of conflict and elated with triumph. Her eyes were
shining. She bathed the wound&mdash;the bullet had passed
clean through the fleshy part of the arm&mdash;and then carefully
tied the scarf round it over her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s as good as a man could do it,&#8221; she said,
at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;As good as any doctor,&#8221; he rejoined.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t talking of your arm,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course not. Excuse me. You was talkin&#8217; of them
rapids, and I&#8217;ve got to say there ain&#8217;t a man that could
have done it and come through like you. I guess the
man that marries you&#8217;ll get more than his share of
luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want none of that,&#8221; she said, sharply, and picked
up her paddle again, her eyes flashing anger.</p>
<p>He took a pistol from his pocket and offered it to
her. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean any harm by what I said. Take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
this if you think I won&#8217;t know how to behave myself,&#8221;
he urged.</p>
<p>She flung up her head a little. &#8220;I knew what I was
doing before I started,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Put it away. How
far is it, and can we do it in time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can hold out, we can do it; but it means
going all night and all morning; and it ain&#8217;t dawn yet,
by a long shot.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Dawn came at last, and the mist of early morning,
and the imperious and dispelling sun; and with mouthfuls
of food as they drifted on, the two fixed their eyes
on the horizon beyond which lay Bindon. And now
it seemed to the girl as though this race to save a life,
or many lives, was the one thing in existence. <i>To-morrow</i>
was to-day, and the white petticoat was lying
in the little house in the mountains, and her wedding
was an interminable distance off, so had this adventure
drawn her into its risks and toils and haggard exhaustion.</p>
<p>Eight, nine, ten, eleven o&#8217;clock came, and then they
saw signs of settlement. Houses appeared here and
there upon the banks, and now and then a horseman
watched them from the shore, but they could not pause.
Bindon&mdash;Bindon&mdash;Bindon&mdash;the Snowdrop Mine at Bindon,
and a death-dealing machine timed to do its deadly
work, were before the eyes of the two <i>voyageurs</i>.</p>
<p>Half-past eleven, and the town of Bindon was just
beyond them. A quarter to twelve, and they had run
their canoe into the bank beyond which were the smokestacks
and chimneys of the mine. Bindon was peacefully
pursuing its way, though here and there were little
groups of strikers who had not resumed work.</p>
<p>Dingley and the girl scrambled up the bank. Trembling
with fatigue, they hastened on. The man drew
ahead of her, for she had paddled for fifteen hours,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
practically without ceasing, and the ground seemed to
rise up at her. But she would not let him stop.</p>
<p>He hurried on, reached the mine, and entered, shouting
the name of his friend. It was seven minutes to
twelve.</p>
<p>A moment later, a half-dozen men came rushing from
that portion of the mine where Dingley had been told
the machine was placed, and at their head was Lawson,
the man he had come to save.</p>
<p>The girl hastened on to meet them, but she grew faint
and leaned against a tree, scarce conscious. She was
roused by voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t me, it wasn&#8217;t me that done it; it was
a girl. Here she is&mdash;Jenny Long! You got to thank
her, Jake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jake! Jake! The girl awakened to full understanding
now. Jake&mdash;what Jake? She looked, then stumbled
forward with a cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jake&mdash;it was my Jake!&#8221; she faltered.</p>
<p>The mine-boss caught her in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Jenny! It&#8217;s you that&#8217;s saved me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a rumble as of thunder, and a
cloud of dust and stone rose from the Snowdrop Mine.</p>
<p>The mine-boss tightened his arm round the girl&#8217;s
waist. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I missed, through him and you,
Jenny,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was you doing here, and not at Selby, Jake?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;They sent for me&mdash;to stop the trouble here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about our wedding to-day?&#8221; she asked, with a frown.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man went from here with a letter to you three
days ago,&#8221; he said, &#8220;asking you to come down here
and be married. I suppose he got drunk, or had an
accident, and didn&#8217;t reach you. It had to be. I was
needed here&mdash;couldn&#8217;t tell what would happen.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It has happened out all right,&#8221; said Dingley, &#8220;and
this&#8217;ll be the end of it. You got them miners solid
now. The strikers&#8217;ll eat humble pie after to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be married to-day, just the same,&#8221; the mine-boss
said, as he gave some brandy to the girl.</p>
<p>But the girl shook her head. She was thinking of
a white petticoat in a little house in the mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be married to-day,&#8221; she said,
decisively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to-morrow,&#8221; said the mine-boss.</p>
<p>But the girl shook her head again. &#8220;To-day is to-morrow,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;You can wait, Jake. I&#8217;m
going back home to be married.&#8221;</p>

<h2>QU&#8217;APPELLE </h2>
</div>

<div class='ce'>
<p>(<i>Who calls?</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m white; I&#8217;m not an Indian. My father was
a white man. I&#8217;ve been brought up as a white girl.
I&#8217;ve had a white girl&#8217;s schooling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed as she sprang to her feet and walked
up and down the room for a moment, then stood still,
facing her mother&mdash;a dark-faced, pock-marked woman,
with heavy, somnolent eyes&mdash;and waited for her to
speak. The reply came slowly and sullenly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a Blackfoot woman. I lived on the Muskwat
River among the braves for thirty years. I have killed
buffalo. I have seen battles. Men, too, I have killed
when they came to steal our horses and crept in on
our lodges in the night&mdash;the Crees! I am a Blackfoot.
You are the daughter of a Blackfoot woman. No
medicine can cure that. Sit down. You have no sense.
You are not white. They will not have you. Sit
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s handsome face flushed; she threw up her
hands in an agony of protest. A dreadful anger was
in her panting breast, but she could not speak. She
seemed to choke with excess of feeling. For an instant
she stood still, trembling with agitation, then she sat
down suddenly on a great couch covered with soft deer-skins
and buffalo robes. There was deep in her the
habit of obedience to this sombre but striking woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
She had been ruled firmly, almost oppressively, and
she had not yet revolted. Seated on the couch, she
gazed out of the window at the flying snow, her brain
too much on fire for thought, passion beating like a
pulse in all her lithe and graceful young body, which
had known the storms of life and time for only twenty
years.</p>
<p>The wind shrieked and the snow swept past in clouds
of blinding drift, completely hiding from sight the town
below them, whose civilization had built itself many
habitations and was making roads and streets on the
green-brown plain, where herds of buffalo had stamped
and streamed and thundered not long ago. The town
was a mile and a half away, and these two were alone
in a great circle of storm, one of them battling against
a tempest which might yet overtake her, against which
she had set her face ever since she could remember;
though it had only come to violence since her father
died two years before&mdash;a careless, strong, wilful white
man, who had lived the Indian life for many years, but
had been swallowed at last by the great wave of civilization
streaming westward and northward, wiping out
the game and the Indian, and overwhelming the rough,
fighting, hunting, pioneer life. Joel Renton had made
money, by good luck chiefly, having held land here and
there which he had got for nothing, and had then almost
forgotten about it, and, when reminded of it, still held
on to it with that defiant stubbornness which often
possesses improvident and careless natures. He had
never had any real business instinct, and to swagger a
little over the land he held and to treat offers of purchase
with contempt was the loud assertion of a capacity
he did not possess. So it was that stubborn vanity,
beneath which was his angry protest against the prejudice
felt by the new people of the West for the white
pioneer who married an Indian and lived the Indian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
life&mdash;so it was that this gave him competence and a
comfortable home after the old trader had been driven
out by the railway and the shopkeeper. With the first
land he sold he sent his daughter away to school in a
town farther east and south, where she had been brought
in touch with a life that at once cramped and attracted
her; where, too, she had felt the first chill of racial
ostracism, and had proudly fought it to the end, her
weapons being talent, industry, and a hot, defiant ambition.</p>
<p>There had been three years of bitter, almost half-sullen,
struggle, lightened by one sweet friendship with
a girl whose face she had since drawn in a hundred different
poses on stray pieces of paper, on the walls of
the big, well-lighted attic to which she retreated for
hours every day, when she was not abroad on the prairies,
riding the Indian pony that her uncle the Piegan Chief,
Ice Breaker, had given her years before. Three years
of struggle, and then her father had died, and the refuge
for her vexed, defiant heart was gone. While he
lived she could affirm the rights of a white man&#8217;s daughter,
the rights of the daughter of a pioneer who had
helped to make the West; and her pride in him had
given a glow to her cheek and a spring to her step which
drew every eye. In the chief street of Portage la
Drôme men would stop their trafficking and women
nudge one another when she passed, and wherever she
went she stirred interest, excited admiration, or aroused
prejudice&mdash;but the prejudice did not matter so long as
her father, Joel Renton, lived. Whatever his faults,
and they were many&mdash;sometimes he drank too much,
and swore a great deal, and bullied and stormed&mdash;she
blinked at them all, for he was of the conquering
race, a white man who had slept in white sheets and
eaten off white tablecloths, and used a knife and fork,
since he was born; and the women of his people had had
soft petticoats and fine stockings, and silk gowns for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
festal days, and feathered hats of velvet, and shoes of
polished leather, always and always, back through many
generations. She had held her head high, for she was
of his women, of the women of his people, with all their
rights and all their claims. She had held it high till
that stormy day&mdash;just such a day as this, with the surf
of snow breaking against the house&mdash;when they carried
him in out of the wild turmoil and snow, laying him on
the couch where she now sat, and her head fell on his
lifeless breast, and she cried out to him in vain to come
back to her.</p>
<p>Before the world her head was still held high, but in
the attic-room, and out on the prairies far away, where
only the coyote or the prairie hen saw, her head drooped,
and her eyes grew heavy with pain and sombre protest.
Once in an agony of loneliness, and cruelly hurt by a
conspicuous slight put upon her at the Portage by the
wife of the Reeve of the town, who had daughters twain
of pure white blood got from behind the bar of a saloon
in Winnipeg, she had thrown open her window at night,
with the frost below zero, and stood in her thin nightdress,
craving the death which she hoped the cold would
give her soon. It had not availed, however, and once
again she had ridden out in a blizzard to die, but had
come upon a man lost in the snow, and her own misery
had passed from her, and her heart, full of the blood of
plainsmen, had done for another what it would not do
for itself. The Indian in her had, with strange, sure
instinct, found its way to Portage la Drôme, the man,
with both hands and one foot frozen, on her pony, she
walking at his side, only conscious that she had saved
one, not two lives that day.</p>
<p>Here was another such day, here again was the storm
in her heart which had driven her into the plains that
other time, and here again was that tempest of white
death outside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p><i>&#8220;You have no sense. You are not white. They will
not have you. Sit down</i>&mdash;&#8221; The words had fallen on
her ears with a cold, deadly smother. There came a
chill upon her which stilled the wild pulses in her,
which suddenly robbed the eyes of their brightness and
gave a drawn look to the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not white. They will not have you, Pauline.&#8221;
The Indian mother repeated the words after a
moment, her eyes grown still more gloomy; for in her,
too, there was a dark tide of passion moving. In all
the outlived years this girl had ever turned to the white
father rather than to her, and she had been left more
and more alone. Her man had been kind to her, and
she had been a faithful wife, but she had resented the
natural instinct of her half-breed child, almost white
herself and with the feelings and ways of the whites, to
turn always to her father, as though to a superior guide,
to a higher influence and authority. Was not she herself
the descendant of Blackfoot and Piegan chiefs
through generations of rulers and warriors? Was there
not Piegan and Blackfoot blood in the girl&#8217;s veins?
Must only the white man&#8217;s blood be reckoned when
they made up their daily account and balanced the
books of their lives, credit and debtor&mdash;misunderstanding
and kind act, neglect and tenderness, reproof and
praise, gentleness and impulse, anger and caress&mdash;to be
set down in the everlasting record? Why must the
Indian always give way&mdash;Indian habits, Indian desires,
the Indian way of doing things, the Indian point of
view, Indian food, Indian medicine? Was it all bad,
and only that which belonged to white life good?</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at your face in the glass, Pauline,&#8221; she added,
at last. &#8220;You are good-looking, but it isn&#8217;t the good
looks of the whites. The lodge of a chieftainess is the
place for you. There you would have praise and honor;
among the whites you are only a half-breed. What is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the good? Let us go back to the life out there beyond
the Muskwat River&mdash;up beyond. There is hunting still,
a little, and the world is quiet, and nothing troubles.
Only the wild dog barks at night, or the wolf sniffs at
the door, and all day there is singing. Somewhere out
beyond the Muskwat the feasts go on, and the old men
build the great fires, and tell tales, and call the wind
out of the north, and make the thunder speak; and the
young men ride to the hunt or go out to battle, and
build lodges for the daughters of the tribe; and each
man has his woman, and each woman has in her breast
the honor of the tribe, and the little ones fill the lodge
with laughter. Like a pocket of deerskin is every house,
warm and small and full of good things. <i>Hai-yai</i>, what
is this life to that! There you will be head and chief of
all, for there is money enough for a thousand horses;
and your father was a white man, and these are the
days when the white man rules. Like clouds before the
sun are the races of men, and one race rises and another
falls. Here you are not first, but last; and the child
of the white father and mother, though they be as the
dirt that flies from a horse&#8217;s heels, it is before you.
Your mother is a Blackfoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the woman spoke slowly and with many pauses,
the girl&#8217;s mood changed, and there came into her eyes
a strange, dark look deeper than anger. She listened
with a sudden patience which stilled the agitation in
her breast and gave a little touch of rigidity to her
figure. Her eyes withdrew from the wild storm without
and gravely settled on her mother&#8217;s face, and with the
Indian woman&#8217;s last words understanding pierced, but
did not dispel, the sombre and ominous look in her
eyes.</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment, and then she spoke
almost as evenly as her mother had done.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you everything. You are my mother, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
I love you; but you will not see the truth. When my
father took you from the lodges and brought you here,
it was the end of the Indian life. It was for you to go on
with him, but you would not go. I was young, but I
saw, and I said that in all things I would go with him.
I did not know that it would be hard, but at school,
at the very first, I began to understand. There was
only one, a French girl&mdash;I loved her&mdash;a girl who said
to me, &#8216;You are as white as I am, as any one, and your
heart is the same, and you are beautiful.&#8217; Yes, Manette
said I was beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused a moment, a misty, far-away look came
into her eyes, her fingers clasped and unclasped, and
she added:</p>
<p>&#8220;And her brother, Julien&mdash;he was older&mdash;when he
came to visit Manette he spoke to me as though I was
all white, and was good to me. I have never forgotten,
never. It was five years ago, but I remember him.
He was tall and strong, and as good as Manette&mdash;as
good as Manette. I loved Manette, but she suffered
for me, for I was not like the others, and my ways
were different&mdash;then. I had lived up there on the
Warais among the lodges, and I had not seen things&mdash;only
from my father, and he did so much in an Indian
way. So I was sick at heart, and sometimes I wanted
to die; and once&mdash;But there was Manette, and she
would laugh and sing, and we would play together, and
I would speak French and she would speak English, and
I learned from her to forget the Indian ways. What
were they to me? I had loved them when I was of
them, but I came on to a better life. The Indian life
is to the white life as the parfleche pouch to&mdash;to this.&#8221;
She laid her hand upon a purse of delicate silver mesh
hanging at her waist. &#8220;When your eyes are opened
you must go on, you cannot stop. There is no going
back. When you have read of all there is in the white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
man&#8217;s world, when you have seen, then there is no
returning. You may end it all, if you wish, in the
snow, in the river, but there is no returning. The
lodge of a chief&mdash;ah, if my father had heard you say
that&mdash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian woman shifted heavily in her chair, then
shrank away from the look fixed on her. Once or twice
she made as if she would speak, but sank down in the
great chair, helpless and dismayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lodge of a chief!&#8221; the girl continued, in a low,
bitter voice. &#8220;What is the lodge of a chief? A smoky
fire, a pot, a bed of skins&mdash;<i>aih-yi</i>! If the lodges of the
Indians were millions, and I could be head of all, and
rule the land, yet would I rather be a white girl in the
hut of her white man, struggling for daily bread among
the people who sweep the buffalo out, but open up the
land with the plough, and make a thousand live where
one lived before. It is peace you want, my mother,
peace and solitude, in which the soul goes to sleep.
Your days of hope are over, and you want to drowse by
the fire. I want to see the white man&#8217;s cities grow, and
the armies coming over the hill with the ploughs and
the reapers and the mowers, and the wheels and the
belts and engines of the great factories, and the white
woman&#8217;s life spreading everywhere; for I am a white
man&#8217;s daughter. I can&#8217;t be both Indian and white. I
will not be like the sun when the shadow cuts across it
and the land grows dark. I will not be half-breed. I
will be white or I will be Indian; and I will be white,
white only. My heart is white, my tongue is white, I
think, I feel, as white people think and feel. What they
wish, I wish; as they live, I live; as white women dress,
I dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>She involuntarily drew up the dark-red skirt she wore,
showing a white petticoat and a pair of fine stockings
on an ankle as shapely as she had ever seen among all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
the white women she knew. She drew herself up with
pride, and her body had a grace and ease which the
white woman&#8217;s convention had not cramped.</p>
<p>Yet, with all her protests, no one would have thought
her English. She might have been Spanish, or Italian,
or Roumanian, or Slav, though nothing of her Indian
blood showed in purely Indian characteristics, and something
sparkled in her, gave a radiance to her face and
figure which the storm and struggle in her did not
smother. The white women of Portage la Drôme were
too blind, too prejudiced, to see all that she really was,
and admiring white men could do little, for Pauline
would have nothing to do with them till the women
met her absolutely as an equal; and from the other
half-breeds, who intermarried with one another and were
content to take a lower place than the pure whites, she
held aloof, save when any of them was ill or in trouble.
Then she recognized the claim of race, and came to their
doors with pity and soft impulses to help them. French
and Scotch and English half-breeds, as they were, they
understood how she was making a fight for all who were
half-Indian, half-white, and watched her with a furtive
devotion, acknowledging her superior place, and proud
of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not stay here,&#8221; said the Indian mother, with
sullen stubbornness. &#8220;I will go back beyond the
Warais. My life is my own life, and I will do what I
like with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl started, but became composed again on the
instant. &#8220;Is your life all your own, mother?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;I did not come into the world of my own will.
If I had I would have come all white or all Indian. I
am your daughter, and I am here, good or bad&mdash;is your
life all your own?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can marry and stay here, when I go. You are
twenty. I had my man, your father, when I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
seventeen. You can marry. There are men. You
have money. They will marry you&mdash;and forget the
rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a cry of rage and misery the girl sprang to her
feet and started forward, but stopped suddenly at sound
of a hasty knocking and a voice asking admittance.
An instant later, a huge, bearded, broad-shouldered man
stepped inside, shaking himself free of the snow, laughing
half-sheepishly as he did so, and laying his fur cap
and gloves with exaggerated care on the wide window-sill.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Alloway,&#8221; said the Indian woman, in a voice
of welcome and with a brightening eye, for it would
seem as though he came in answer to her words of a few
moments before. With a mother&#8217;s instinct she had
divined at once the reason for the visit, though no
warning thought crossed the mind of the girl, who
placed a chair for their visitor with a heartiness which
was real&mdash;was not this the white man she had saved
from death in the snow a year ago? Her heart was
soft toward the life she had kept in the world. She
smiled at him, all the anger gone from her eyes, and
there was almost a touch of tender anxiety in her voice
as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;What brought you out in this blizzard? It wasn&#8217;t
safe. It doesn&#8217;t seem possible you got here from the
Portage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The huge ranchman and auctioneer laughed cheerily.
&#8220;Once lost, twice get there,&#8221; he exclaimed, with a quizzical
toss of the head, thinking he had said a good thing.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a year ago to the very day that I was lost out
back&#8221;&mdash;he jerked a thumb over his shoulder&mdash;&#8220;and you
picked me up and brought me in; and what was I to
do but come out on the anniversary and say thank you?
I&#8217;d fixed up all year to come to you, and I wasn&#8217;t to be
stopped, &#8217;cause it was like the day we first met, old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
Coldmaker hitting the world with his whips of frost,
and shaking his ragged blankets of snow over the wild
West.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just such a day,&#8221; said the Indian woman, after a
pause. Pauline remained silent, placing a little bottle
of cordial before their visitor, with which he presently
regaled himself, raising his glass with an air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many happy returns to us both!&#8221; he said, and threw
the liqueur down his throat, smacked his lips, and drew
his hand down his great mustache and beard, like some
vast animal washing its face with its paw. Smiling,
and yet not at ease, he looked at the two women and
nodded his head encouragingly, but whether the encouragement
was for himself or for them he could not
have told.</p>
<p>His last words, however, had altered the situation.
The girl had caught at a suggestion in them which
startled her. This rough, white plainsman was come to
make love to her, and to say&mdash;what? He was at once
awkward and confident, afraid of her, of her refinement,
grace, beauty, and education, and yet confident in the
advantage of his position, a white man bending to a
half-breed girl. He was not conscious of the condescension
and majesty of his demeanor, but it was there, and
his untutored words and ways must make it all too
apparent to the girl. The revelation of the moment
made her at once triumphant and humiliated. This
white man had come to make love to her, that was
apparent; but that he, ungrammatical, crude, and
rough, should think he had but to put out his hand, and
she in whom every subtle emotion and influence had delicate
response, whose words and ways were as far removed
from his as day from night, would fly to him,
brought the flush of indignation to her cheek. She responded
to his toast with a pleasant nod, however, and
said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But if you will keep coming in such wild storms,
there will not be many anniversaries.&#8221; Laughing, she
poured out another glass of liqueur for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, p&#8217;r&#8217;aps you&#8217;re right, and so the only
thing to do is not to keep coming, but to stay&mdash;stay
right where <i>you</i> are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian woman could not see her daughter&#8217;s face,
which was turned to the fire, but she herself smiled at
John Alloway, and nodded her head approvingly. Here
was the cure for her own trouble and loneliness. Pauline
and she, who lived in different worlds, and yet were tied
to each other by circumstances they could not control,
would each work out her own destiny after her own
nature, since John Alloway had come a-wooing. She
would go back on the Warais, and Pauline would remain
at the Portage, a white woman with her white man.
She would go back to the smoky fires in the huddled
lodges; to the venison stew and the snake dance; to
the feasts of the medicine-men, and the long sleeps in
the summer days, and the winter&#8217;s tales, and be at
rest among her own people; and Pauline would have
revenge of the wife of the prancing Reeve, and
perhaps the people would forget who her mother
was.</p>
<p>With these thoughts flying through her sluggish
mind, she rose and moved heavily from the room, with
a parting look of encouragement at Alloway, as though
to say, a man that is bold is surest.</p>
<p>With her back to the man, Pauline watched her
mother leave the room, saw the look she gave Alloway.
When the door was closed she turned and looked Alloway
in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;How old are you?&#8221; she asked, suddenly.</p>
<p>He stirred in his seat nervously. &#8220;Why, fifty, about,&#8221;
he answered, with confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll be wise not to go looking for anniversaries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
in blizzards, when they&#8217;re few at the best,&#8221; she
said, with a gentle and dangerous smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty&mdash;why, I&#8217;m as young as most men of thirty,&#8221;
he responded, with an uncertain laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;d have come
here to-day if it had been snowing pitchforks and chain-lightning.
I made up my mind I would. You saved
my life, that&#8217;s dead sure; and I&#8217;d be down among the
moles if it wasn&#8217;t for you and that Piegan pony of yours.
Piegan ponies are wonders in a storm&mdash;seem to know
their way by instinct. You, too&mdash;why, I bin on the
plains all my life, and was no better than a baby that
day; but you&mdash;why, you had Piegan in you&mdash;why, yes&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped short for a moment, checked by the look
in her face, then went blindly on: &#8220;And you&#8217;ve got
Blackfoot in you, too; and you just felt your way
through the tornado and over the blind prairie like a
bird reaching for the hills. It was as easy to you as
picking out a maverick in a bunch of steers to me.
But I never could make out what you was doing on the
prairie that terrible day. I&#8217;ve thought of it a hundred
times. What was you doing, if it ain&#8217;t cheek to ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was trying to lose a life,&#8221; she answered, quietly,
her eyes dwelling on his face, yet not seeing him; for
it all came back on her, the agony which had driven her
out into the tempest to be lost evermore.</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;Well now, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;that&#8217;s what they call speaking sarcastic. You was
out to save, and not to lose, a life; that was proved to
the satisfaction of the court.&#8221; He paused and chuckled
to himself, thinking he had been witty, and continued:
&#8220;And I was that court, and my judgment was that the
debt of that life you saved had to be paid to you within
one calendar year, with interest at the usual per cent.
for mortgages on good security. That was my judgment,
and there&#8217;s no appeal from it. I am the great
Justinian in this case!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever save anybody&#8217;s life?&#8221; she asked, putting
the bottle of cordial away, as he filled his glass for
the third time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice certain, and once divided the honors,&#8221; he
answered, pleased at the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you expect to get any pay, with or without
interest?&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me! I never thought of it again. But yes&mdash;by gol,
I did! One case was funny, as funny can be. It was
Ricky Wharton over on the Muskwat River. I saved
his life right enough, and he came to me a year after and
said, &#8216;You saved my life, now what are you going to do
with it? I&#8217;m stony broke. I owe a hundred dollars,
and I wouldn&#8217;t be owing it if you hadn&#8217;t saved my life.
When you saved it I was five hundred to the good, and
I&#8217;d have left that much behind me. Now I&#8217;m on the
rocks, because you insisted on saving my life; and you
just got to take care of me.&#8217; I &#8216;insisted&#8217;! Well, that
knocked me silly, and I took him on&mdash;blame me, if I
didn&#8217;t keep Ricky a whole year, till he went north looking
for gold. Get pay?&mdash;why, I <i>paid</i>! Saving life has
its responsibilities, little gal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t save life without running some risk yourself,
not as a rule, can you?&#8221; she said, shrinking from
his familiarity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as a rule,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;You took on a bit of
risk with me, you and your Piegan pony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was young,&#8221; she responded, leaning over the
table and drawing faces on a piece of paper before her.
&#8220;I could take more risks, I was only nineteen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t catch on,&#8221; he rejoined. &#8220;If it&#8217;s sixteen
or&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or fifty,&#8221; she interposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What difference does it make? If you&#8217;re done for,
it&#8217;s the same at nineteen as fifty, and <i>vicey-versey</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not the same,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You leave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
so much more that you want to keep, when you go at
fifty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I dunno. I never thought of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s all that has belonged to you. You&#8217;ve been
married, and have children, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He started, frowned, then straightened himself. &#8220;I got
one girl&mdash;she&#8217;s East with her grandmother,&#8221; he said, jerkily.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said; there&#8217;s more to leave behind at
fifty,&#8221; she replied, a red spot on each cheek. She was
not looking at him, but at the face of a man on the
paper before her&mdash;a young man with abundant hair, a
strong chin, and big, eloquent eyes; and all around his
face she had drawn the face of a girl many times, and
beneath the faces of both she was writing <i>Manette and
Julien</i>.</p>
<p>The water was getting too deep for John Alloway.
He floundered toward the shore. &#8220;I&#8217;m no good at
words,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;no good at argyment; but I&#8217;ve got
a gift for stories&mdash;round the fire of a night, with a pipe
and tin basin of tea; so I&#8217;m not going to try and match
you. You&#8217;ve had a good education down at Winnipeg.
Took every prize, they say, and led the school, though
there was plenty of fuss because they let you do it, and
let you stay there, being half-Indian. You never heard
what was going on outside, I s&#8217;pose. It didn&#8217;t matter,
for you won out. Blamed foolishness, trying to draw
the line between red and white that way. Of course,
it&#8217;s the women always, always the women, striking out
for all-white or nothing. Down there at Portage they&#8217;ve
treated you mean, mean as dirt. The Reeve&#8217;s wife&mdash;well,
we&#8217;ll fix that up all right. I guess John Alloway
ain&#8217;t to be bluffed. He knows too much, and they all
know he knows enough. When John Alloway, 32 Main
Street, with a ranch on the Katanay, says, &#8216;We&#8217;re coming,
Mr. and Mrs. John Alloway is coming,&#8217; they&#8217;ll get
out their cards <i>visite</i>, I guess.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>Pauline&#8217;s head bent lower, and she seemed laboriously
etching lines into the faces before her&mdash;Manette and
Julien, Julien and Manette; and there came into her
eyes the youth and light and gayety of the days when
Julien came of an afternoon and the riverside rang
with laughter&mdash;the dearest, lightest days she had ever
spent.</p>
<p>The man of fifty went on, seeing nothing but a girl
over whom he was presently going to throw the lasso
of his affection and take her home with him, yielding
and glad, a white man and his half-breed girl&mdash;but such
a half-breed!</p>
<p>&#8220;I seen enough of the way some of them women
treated you,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and I sez to myself, Her
turn next. There&#8217;s a way out, I sez, and John Alloway
pays his debts. When the anniversary comes round
I&#8217;ll put things right, I sez to myself. She saved my
life, and she shall have the rest of it, if she&#8217;ll take it,
and will give a receipt in full, and open a new account
in the name of John and Pauline Alloway. Catch it?
See&mdash;Pauline?&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly she got to her feet. There was a look in her
eyes such as had been in her mother&#8217;s a little while
before, but a hundred times intensified, a look that
belonged to the flood and flow of generations of Indian
life, yet controlled in her by the order and understanding
of centuries of white men&#8217;s lives, the pervasive,
dominating power of race.</p>
<p>For an instant she kept her eyes toward the window.
The storm had suddenly ceased, and a glimmer of sunset
light was breaking over the distant wastes of snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to pay a debt you think you owe,&#8221; she
said, in a strange, lustreless voice, turning to him at
last. &#8220;Well, you have paid it. You have given me a
book to read which I will keep always. And I give
you a receipt in full for your debt.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about any book,&#8221; he answered, dazedly.
&#8220;I want to marry you right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry, but it is not necessary,&#8221; she replied,
suggestively. Her face was very pale now.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want to. It ain&#8217;t a debt. That was only a
way of putting it. I want to make you my wife. I
got some position, and I can make the West sit up and
look at you and be glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly her anger flared out, low and vivid and
fierce, but her words were slow and measured. &#8220;There
is no reason why I should marry you&mdash;not one. You
offer me marriage as a prince might give a penny to a
beggar. If my mother were not an Indian woman, you
would not have taken it all as a matter of course. But
my father was a white man, and I am a white man&#8217;s
daughter, and I would rather marry an Indian, who
would think me the best thing there was in the light of
the sun, than marry you. Had I been pure white you
would not have been so sure; you would have asked,
not offered. I am not obliged to you. You ought to
go to no woman as you came to me. See, the storm has
stopped. You will be quite safe going back now. The
snow will be deep, perhaps, but it is not far.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went to the window, got his cap and gloves, and
handed them to him. He took them, dumbfounded and
overcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I ain&#8217;t done it right, mebbe, but I meant well,
and I&#8217;d be good to you and proud of you, and I&#8217;d love
you better than anything I ever saw,&#8221; he said, shamefacedly,
but eagerly and honestly, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you should have said those last words first,&#8221;
she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say them now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They come too late; but they would have been too
late in any case,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Still, I am glad you
said them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>She opened the door for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made a mistake,&#8221; he urged, humbly. &#8220;I understand
better now. I never had any schoolin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; she answered, gently. &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly he turned. &#8220;You&#8217;re right&mdash;it couldn&#8217;t ever
be,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re&mdash;you&#8217;re great. And I owe you
my life still!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped out into the biting air.</p>
<p>For a moment Pauline stood motionless in the middle
of the room, her gaze fixed upon the door which had
just closed; then, with a wild gesture of misery and
despair, she threw herself upon the couch in a passionate
outburst of weeping. Sobs shook her from head to
foot, and her hands, clenched above her head, twitched
convulsively.</p>
<p>Presently the door opened and her mother looked in
eagerly. At what she saw her face darkened and hardened
for an instant, but then the girl&#8217;s utter abandonment
of grief and agony convinced and conquered her.
Some glimmer of the true understanding of the problem
which Pauline represented got into her heart and drove
the sullen selfishness from her face and eyes and mind.
She came over heavily and, sinking upon her knees,
swept an arm around the girl&#8217;s shoulder. She realized
what had happened, and probably this was the first
time in her life that she had ever come by instinct to
a revelation of her daughter&#8217;s mind or of the faithful
meaning of incidents of their lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said no to John Alloway,&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>Defiance and protest spoke in the swift gesture of the
girl&#8217;s hands. &#8220;You think because he was white that
I&#8217;d drop into his arms! No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did right, little one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sobs suddenly stopped, and the girl seemed to
listen with all her body. There was something in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
Indian mother&#8217;s voice she had never heard before&mdash;at
least, not since she was a little child and swung in a
deerskin hammock in a tamarac-tree by Renton&#8217;s
Lodge, where the chiefs met and the West paused to
rest on its onward march. Something of the accents
of the voice that crooned to her then was in the woman&#8217;s
tones now.</p>
<p>&#8220;He offered it like a lump of sugar to a bird&mdash;I know.
He didn&#8217;t know that you have great blood&mdash;yes, but it
is true. My man&#8217;s grandfather, he was of the blood
of the kings of England. My man had the proof. And
for a thousand years my people have been chiefs. There
is no blood in all the West like yours. My heart was
heavy, and dark thoughts came to me, because my man
is gone, and the life is not my life, and I am only an
Indian woman from the Warais, and my heart goes out
there always now. But some great Medicine has been
poured into my heart. As I stood at the door and saw
you lying there, I called to the Sun. &#8216;O great Spirit,&#8217;
I said, &#8216;help me to understand, for this girl is bone of
my bone and flesh of my flesh, and Evil has come
between us!&#8217; And the Sun Spirit poured the Medicine
into my spirit, and there is no cloud between us now.
It has passed away, and I see. Little white one, the
white life is the only life, and I will live it with you till
a white man comes and gives you a white man&#8217;s home.
But not John Alloway. Shall the crow nest with the
oriole?&#8221;</p>
<p>As the woman spoke with slow, measured voice full
of the cadences of a heart revealing itself, the girl&#8217;s
breath at first seemed to stop, so still she lay; then, as
the true understanding of the words came to her, she
panted with excitement, her breast heaved, and the
blood flushed her face. When the slow voice ceased,
and the room became still, she lay quiet for a moment,
letting the new thing find secure lodgment in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
thought; then, suddenly, she raised herself and threw
her arms round her mother in a passion of affection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lalika! O mother Lalika!&#8221; she said, tenderly, and
kissed her again and again. Not since she was a little
girl, long before they left the Warais, had she called her
mother by her Indian name, which her father had humorously
taught her to do in those far-off happy days
by the beautiful, singing river and the exquisite woods,
when, with a bow and arrow, she had ranged, a young
Diana who slew only with love.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lalika, mother Lalika, it is like the old, old times,&#8221;
she added, softly. &#8220;Ah, it does not matter now, for
you understand!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand altogether,&#8221; murmured the Indian
woman, gently. &#8220;I am not white, and there is a
different way of thinking; but I will hold your hand,
and we will live the white life together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cheek to cheek they saw the darkness come, and
afterwards the silver moon steal up over a frozen world,
in which the air bit like steel and braced the heart like
wine. Then, at last, before it was nine o&#8217;clock, after
her custom, the Indian woman went to bed, leaving her
daughter brooding peacefully by the fire.</p>
<p>For a long time Pauline sat with hands clasped in
her lap, her gaze on the tossing flames, in her heart and
mind a new feeling of strength and purpose. The way
before her was not clear, she saw no further than this
day, and all that it had brought; yet she was as one
that has crossed a direful flood and finds herself on a
strange shore in an unknown country, with the twilight
about her, yet with so much of danger passed that there
was only the thought of the moment&#8217;s safety round her,
the camp-fire to be lit, and the bed to be made under
the friendly trees and stars.</p>
<p>For a half-hour she sat so, and then, suddenly, she
raised her head listening, leaning toward the window,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
through which the moonlight streamed. She heard her
name called without, distinct and strange&mdash;&#8220;<i>Pauline!
Pauline!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Starting up, she ran to the door and opened it. All
was silent and cruelly cold. Nothing but the wide plain
of snow and the steely air. But as she stood intently
listening, the red glow from the fire behind her, again
came the cry&mdash;&#8220;Pauline!&#8221;&mdash;not far away. Her heart
beat hard, and she raised her head and called&mdash;why was
it she should call out in a language not her own?&mdash;&#8220;<i>Qu&#8217;appelle?
Qu&#8217;appelle?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>And once again on the still night air came the trembling
appeal, &#8220;Pauline!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Qu&#8217;appelle? Qu&#8217;appelle</i>?&#8221; she cried; then, with a
gasping murmur of understanding and recognition she
ran forward in the frozen night toward the sound of
the voice. The same intuitive sense which had made
her call out in French, without thought or reason, had
revealed to her who it was that called; or was it that
even in the one word uttered there was the note of a
voice always remembered since those days with Manette
at Winnipeg?</p>
<p>Not far away from the house, on the way to Portage
la Drôme, but a little distance from the road, was a
crevasse, and toward this she sped, for once before an
accident had happened there. Again the voice called
as she sped&mdash;&#8220;Pauline!&#8221;&mdash;and she cried out that she
was coming. Presently she stood above the declivity,
and peered over. Almost immediately below her, a few
feet down, was a man lying in the snow. He had strayed
from the obliterated road, and had fallen down the
crevasse, twisting his foot cruelly. Unable to walk, he
had crawled several hundred yards in the snow, but
his strength had given out, and then he had called to
the house, on whose dark windows flickered the flames
of the fire, the name of the girl he had come so far to see.</p>

&#8220;PAULINE,&#8221; HE SAID, FEEBLY, AND FAINTED IN HER ARMS<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>With a cry of joy and pain at once she recognized
him now. It was as her heart had said&mdash;it was Julien,
Manette&#8217;s brother. In a moment she was beside him,
her arm around his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pauline!&#8221; he said, feebly, and fainted in her arms.
An instant later she was speeding to the house, and,
rousing her mother and two of the stablemen, she
snatched a flask of brandy from a cupboard and hastened
back.</p>
<p>An hour later Julien Labrosse lay in the great sitting-room
beside the fire, his foot and ankle bandaged, and
at ease, his face alight with all that had brought him
there. And once again the Indian mother with a sure
instinct knew why he had come, and saw that now her
girl would have a white man&#8217;s home, and, for her man,
one of the race like her father&#8217;s race, white and conquering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to give trouble,&#8221; Julien said, laughing&mdash;he
had a trick of laughing lightly; &#8220;but I&#8217;ll be able to get
back to the Portage to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this the Indian mother said, however: &#8220;To please
yourself is a great thing, but to please others is better;
and so you will stay here till you can walk back to the
Portage, M&#8217;sieu&#8217; Julien.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve never been so comfortable,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;never
so happy. If you don&#8217;t mind the trouble!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian woman nodded pleasantly, and found an
excuse to leave the room. But before she went she
contrived to place near his elbow one of the scraps of
paper on which Pauline had drawn his face, with that
of Manette. It brought a light of hope and happiness
into his eyes, and he thrust the paper under the fur
robes of the couch.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing with your life?&#8221; Pauline asked
him, as his eyes sought hers a few moments later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I have a big piece of work before me,&#8221; he answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
eagerly, &#8220;a great chance&mdash;to build a bridge over
the St. Lawrence, and I&#8217;m only thirty! I&#8217;ve got my
start. Then, I&#8217;ve made over the old Seigneury my
father left me, and I&#8217;m going to live in it. It will be a
fine place, when I&#8217;ve done with it, comfortable and big,
with old oak timbers and walls, and deep fireplaces,
and carvings done in the time of Louis Quinze, and
dark-red velvet curtains for the drawing-room, and
skins and furs. Yes, I must have skins and furs like
these here.&#8221; He smoothed the skins with his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Manette, she will live with you?&#8221; Pauline asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, her husband wouldn&#8217;t like that. You see,
Manette is to be married. She told me to tell you all
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told her all that was to tell of Manette&#8217;s courtship,
and added that the wedding would take place in
the spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Manette wanted it when the leaves first flourish
and the birds come back,&#8221; he said, gayly; &#8220;and so she&#8217;s
not going to live with me at the Seigneury, you see.
No, there it is, as fine a house, good enough for a prince,
and I shall be there alone, unless&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes met hers, and he caught the light that was
in them before the eyelids drooped over them and she
turned her head to the fire. &#8220;But the spring is two
months off yet,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The spring?&#8221; she asked, puzzled, yet half afraid to
speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m going into my new house when Manette
goes into her new house&mdash;in the spring. And I won&#8217;t
go alone if&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught her eyes again, but she rose hurriedly and
said: &#8220;You must sleep now. Good-night.&#8221; She held
out her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you the rest to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow
night, when it&#8217;s quiet like this, and the stars shine,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have a home of my own like
this&mdash;ah, <i>bien sûr</i>, Pauline.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night the old Indian mother prayed to the Sun.
&#8220;O great Spirit,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I give thanks for the
Medicine poured into my heart. Be good to my white
child when she goes with her man to the white man&#8217;s
home far away. O great Spirit, when I return to the
lodges of my people, be kind to me, for I shall be lonely;
I shall not have my child; I shall not hear my white
man&#8217;s voice. Give me good Medicine, O Sun and great
Father, till my dream tells me that my man comes from
over the hills for me once more.&#8221;</p>

<h2>THE STAKE AND THE PLUMB-LINE</h2>
</div>

<p>She went against all good judgment in marrying
him; she cut herself off from her own people, from
the life in which she had been an alluring and beautiful
figure. Washington had never had two such seasons
as those in which she moved; for the diplomatic circle
who had had &#8220;the run of the world&#8221; knew her value,
and were not content without her. She might have
made a brilliant match with one ambassador thirty
years older than herself&mdash;she was but twenty-two; and
there were at least six attachés and secretaries of legation
who entered upon a tournament for her heart and
hand; but she was not for them. All her fine faculties
of tact and fairness, of harmless strategy, and her gifts
of wit and unexpected humor were needed to keep her
cavaliers constant and hopeful to the last; but she
never faltered, and she did not fail. The faces of old
men brightened when they saw her, and one or two
ancient figures who, for years, had been seldom seen at
social functions now came when they knew she was to
be present. There were, of course, a few women who
said she would coquette with any male from nine to
ninety; but no man ever said so; and there was none,
from first to last, but smiled with pleasure at even the
mention of her name, so had her vivacity, intelligence,
and fine sympathy conquered them. She was a social
artist by instinct. In their hearts they all recognized
how fair and impartial she was; and she drew out of
every man the best that was in him. The few women
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
who did not like her said that she chattered; but the
truth was she made other people talk by swift suggestion
or delicate interrogation.</p>
<p>After the blow fell, Freddy Hartzman put the matter
succinctly, and told the truth faithfully, when he said:
&#8220;The first time I met her, I told her all I&#8217;d ever done
that could be told, and all I wanted to do; including a
resolve to carry her off to some desert place and set up
a Kingdom of Two. I don&#8217;t know how she did it. I
was like a tap, and poured myself out; and when it was
all over I thought she was the best talker I&#8217;d ever heard.
But yet she&#8217;d done nothing except look at me and listen,
and put in a question here and there, that was like
a baby asking to see your watch. Oh, she was a lily-flower,
was Sally Seabrook, and I&#8217;ve never been sorry
I told her all my little story! It did me good. Poor
darling&mdash;it makes me sick sometimes when I think of it.
Yet she&#8217;ll win out all right&mdash;a hundred to one she&#8217;ll win
out. She was a star.&#8221;</p>
<p>Freddy Hartzman was in an embassy of repute; he
knew the chancelleries and salons of many nations, and
was looked upon as one of the ablest and shrewdest men
in the diplomatic service. He had written one of the
best books on international law in existence, he talked
English like a native, he had published a volume of
delightful verse, and had omitted to publish several
others, including a tiny volume which Sally Seabrook&#8217;s
charms had inspired him to write. His view of her was
shared by most men who knew the world, and especially
by the elderly men who had a real knowledge of human
nature, among whom was a certain important member
of the United States executive called John Appleton.
When the end of all things at Washington came for
Sally, these two men united to bear her up, that her
feet should not stumble upon the stony path of the hard
journey she had undertaken.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
Appleton was not a man of much speech; but his words
had weight; for he was not only a minister; he
came of an old family which had ruled the social destinies
of a state, and had alternately controlled and disturbed
its politics. On the day of the sensation, in the
fiery cloud of which Sally disappeared, Appleton delivered
himself of his mind in the matter at a reception
given by the President.</p>
<p>&#8220;She will come back&mdash;and we will all take her back,
be glad to have her back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She has the grip
of a lever which can lift the eternal hills with the right
pressure. Leave her alone&mdash;leave her alone. This is
a democratic country, and she&#8217;ll prove democracy a
success before she&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The world knew that John Appleton had offered her
marriage, and he had never hidden the fact. What
they did not know was that she had told him what she
meant to do before she did it. He had spoken to her
plainly, bluntly, then with a voice that was blurred and
a little broken, urging her against the course toward
which she was set; but it had not availed; and, realizing
that he had come upon a powerful will underneath the
sunny and so human surface, he had ceased to protest,
to bear down upon her mind with his own iron force.
When he realized that all his reasoning was wasted, that
all worldly argument was vain, he made one last attempt,
a forlorn hope, as though to put upon record
what he believed to be the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no position you cannot occupy,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You have the perfect gift in private life, and you have
a public gift. You have a genius for ruling. Say, my
dear, don&#8217;t wreck it all. I know you are not for me,
but there are better men in the country than I am.
Hartzman will be a great man one day&mdash;he wants you.
Young Tilden wants you; he has millions, and he will
never disgrace them or you, the power which they can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
command, and the power which you have. And there
are others. Your people have told you they will turn
you off; the world will say things&mdash;will rend you.
There is nothing so popular for the moment as the fall
of a favorite. But that&#8217;s nothing&mdash;it&#8217;s nothing at all
compared with the danger to yourself. I didn&#8217;t sleep
last night thinking of it. Yet I&#8217;m glad you wrote me;
it gave me time to think, and I can tell you the truth
as I see it. Haven&#8217;t you thought that he will drag you
down, down, down, wear out your soul, break and sicken
your life, destroy your beauty&mdash;you are beautiful, my
dear, beyond what the world sees, even. Give it up&mdash;ah,
give it up, and don&#8217;t break our hearts! There are
too many people loving you for you to sacrifice them&mdash;and
yourself, too.... You&#8217;ve had such a good time!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been like a dream,&#8221; she interrupted, in a far-away
voice&mdash;&#8220;like a dream, these two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s been such a good dream,&#8221; he urged; &#8220;and
you will only go to a bad one, from which you will never
wake. The thing has fastened on him; he will never
give it up. And penniless, too&mdash;his father has cast him
off. My girl, it&#8217;s impossible. Listen to me. There&#8217;s no
one on earth that would do more for you than I would&mdash;no one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, dear friend!&#8221; she cried, with a sudden impulse,
and caught his hand in hers and kissed it before he
could draw it back. &#8220;You are so true, and you think
you are right. But, but&#8221;&mdash;her eyes took on a deep,
steady, far-away look&mdash;&#8220;but I will save him; and we
shall not be penniless in the end. Meanwhile I have
seven hundred dollars a year of my own. No one can
touch that. Nothing can change me now&mdash;and I have
promised.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he saw her fixed determination, he made no
further protest, but asked that he might help her, be
with her the next day, when she was to take a step
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
which the wise world would say must lead to sorrow and
a miserable end.</p>
<p>The step she took was to marry Jim Templeton, the
drunken, cast-off son of a millionaire senator from Kentucky,
who controlled railways and owned a bank, and
had so resented his son&#8217;s inebriate habits that for five
years he had never permitted Jim&#8217;s name to be mentioned
in his presence. Jim had had twenty thousand
dollars left him by his mother, and a small income of
three hundred dollars from an investment which had
been made for him when a little boy. And this had
carried him on; for, drunken as he was, he had sense
enough to eke out the money, limiting himself to three
thousand dollars a year. He had four thousand dollars
left, and his tiny income of three hundred, when he went
to Sally Seabrook, after having been sober for a month,
and begged her to marry him.</p>
<p>Before dissipation had made him look ten years older
than he was, there had been no handsomer man in all
America. Even yet he had a remarkable face: long,
delicate, with dark-brown eyes, as fair a forehead as
man could wish, and black, waving hair, streaked with
gray&mdash;gray, though he was but twenty-nine years of age.</p>
<p>When Sally was fifteen and he twenty-two, he had
fallen in love with her and she with him; and nothing
had broken the early romance. He had captured her
young imagination, and had fastened his image on her
heart. Her people, seeing the drift of things, had sent
her to a school on the Hudson, and the two did not
meet for some time. Then came a stolen interview,
and a fastening of the rivets of attraction&mdash;for Jim had
gifts of a wonderful kind. He knew his Horace and
Anacreon and Heine and Lamartine and Dante in the
originals, and a hundred others; he was a speaker of
power and grace; and he had a clear, strong head for
business. He was also a lawyer, and was junior attorney
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
to his father&#8217;s great business. It was because he had
the real business gift, not because he had a brilliant and
scholarly mind, that his father had taken him into his
concerns, and was the more unforgiving when he gave
way to temptation. Otherwise, he would have pensioned
Jim off, and dismissed him from his mind as a useless,
insignificant person; for Horace, Anacreon, and philosophy
and history were to him the recreations of the feeble-minded.
He had set his heart on Jim, and what Jim
could do and would do by-and-by in the vast financial
concerns he controlled, when he was ready to slip out
and down; but Jim had disappointed him beyond calculation.</p>
<p>In the early days of their association Jim had left
his post and taken to drink at critical moments in their
operations. At first, high words had been spoken, then
there came the strife of two dissimilar natures, and both
were headstrong, and each proud and unrelenting in his
own way. Then, at last, had come the separation, irrevocable
and painful; and Jim had flung out into the world,
a drunkard, who, sober for a fortnight, or a month, or
three months, would afterward go off on a spree, in
which he quoted Sappho and Horace in taverns, and
sang bacchanalian songs with a voice meant for the
stage&mdash;a heritage from an ancestor who had sung upon
the English stage a hundred years before. Even in his
cups, even after his darling vice had submerged him,
Jim Templeton was a man marked out from his fellows,
distinguished and very handsome. Society, however,
had ceased to recognize him for a long time, and he did
not seek it. For two or three years he practised law
now and then. He took cases, preferably criminal
cases, for which very often he got no pay; but that,
too, ceased at last. Now, in his quiet, sober intervals
he read omnivorously, and worked out problems in
physics for which he had a taste, until the old appetite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
surged over him again. Then his spirits rose, and he
was the old brilliant talker, the joyous galliard until,
in due time, he became silently and lethargically
drunk.</p>
<p>In one of his sober intervals he had met Sally Seabrook
in the street. It was the first time in four years,
for he had avoided her, and though she had written to
him once or twice, he had never answered her&mdash;shame
was in his heart. Yet all the time the old song was in
Sally&#8217;s ears. Jim Templeton had touched her in some
distant and intimate corner of her nature where none
other had reached; and in all her gay life, when men
had told their tale of admiration in their own way, her
mind had gone back to Jim, and what he had said under
the magnolia-trees; and his voice had drowned all
others. She was not blind to what he had become, but
a deep belief possessed her that she, of all the world,
could save him. She knew how futile it would look to
the world, how wild a dream it looked even to her own
heart, how perilous it was; but, play upon the surface
of things as she had done so much and so often in her
brief career, she was seized of convictions having origin,
as it might seem, in something beyond herself.</p>
<p>So when she and Jim met in the street, the old, true
thing rushed upon them both, and for a moment they
stood still and looked at each other. As they might
look who say farewell forever, so did each dwell upon
the other&#8217;s face. That was the beginning of the new
epoch. A few days more, and Jim came to her and
said that she alone could save him; and she meant
him to say it, had led him to the saying, for the same
conviction was burned deep in her own soul. She knew
the awful risk she was taking, that the step must mean
social ostracism, and that her own people would be no
kinder to her than society; but she gasped a prayer,
smiled at Jim as though all were well, laid her plans,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
made him promise her one thing on his knees, and took
the plunge.</p>
<p>Her people did as she expected. She was threatened
with banishment from heart and home&mdash;with disinheritance;
but she pursued her course; and the only
person who stood with her and Jim at the altar was
John Appleton, who would not be denied, and who had
such a half-hour with Jim before the ceremony as neither
of them forgot in the years that the locust ate thereafter.
And, standing at the altar, Jim&#8217;s eyes were still
wet, with new resolves in his heart and a being at his
side meant for the best man in the world. As he knelt
beside her, awaiting the benediction, a sudden sense of
the enormity of this act came upon him, and for her
sake he would have drawn back then, had it not been
too late. He realized that it was a crime to put this
young, beautiful life in peril; that his own life was a
poor, contemptible thing, and that he had been possessed
of the egotism of the selfish and the young.</p>
<p>But the thing was done, and a new life was begun.
Before they were launched upon it, however, before
society had fully grasped the sensation, or they had
left upon their journey to northern Canada, where Sally
intended they should work out their problem and make
their home, far and free from all old associations, a
curious thing happened. Jim&#8217;s father sent an urgent
message to Sally to come to him. When she came, he
told her she was mad, and asked her why she had
thrown her life away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why have you done it?&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&mdash;you
knew all about him; you might have married the best
man in the country. You could rule a kingdom; you
have beauty and power, and make people do what you
want; and you&#8217;ve got a sot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is your son,&#8221; she answered, quietly.</p>
<p>She looked so beautiful and so fine as she stood there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
fearless and challenging before him, that he was moved.
But he would not show it.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was my son&mdash;when he was a man,&#8221; he retorted
grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the son of the woman you once loved,&#8221; she
answered.</p>
<p>The old man turned his head away.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would she have said to what you did to Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew himself around sharply. Her dagger had
gone home, but he would not let her know it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave her out of the question&mdash;she was a saint,&#8221; he
said, roughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She cannot be left out; nor can you. He got his
temperament naturally; he inherited his weakness.
From your grandfather, from her father. Do you think
you are in no way responsible?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, but then said, stubbornly:
&#8220;Why&mdash;why have you done it? What&#8217;s between him
and me can&#8217;t be helped; we are father and son; but
you&mdash;you had no call, no responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love Jim. I always loved him, ever since I can
remember, as you did. I see my way ahead. I will
not desert him. No one cares what happens to him,
no one but me. Your love wouldn&#8217;t stand the test;
mine will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your folks have disinherited you&mdash;you have almost
nothing, and I will not change my mind. What do you
see ahead of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim&mdash;only Jim&mdash;and God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes were shining, her hands were clasped together
at her side in the tenseness of her feeling, her
indomitable spirit spoke in her face.</p>
<p>Suddenly the old man brought his fist down on the
table with a bang. &#8220;It&#8217;s a crime&mdash;oh, it&#8217;s a crime, to
risk your life so! You ought to have been locked up.
I&#8217;d have done it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; she rejoined, quietly. &#8220;I know the
risk. But do you think that I could have lived my life
out, feeling that I might have saved Jim and didn&#8217;t try?
You talk of beauty and power and ruling&mdash;you say
what others have said to me. Which is the greater thing,
to get what pleases one, or to work for something which
is more to one than all else in the world? To save one
life, one intellect, one great man&mdash;oh, he has the making
of a great man in him!&mdash;to save a soul, would not life
be well lost, would not love be well spent, in doing it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Love&#8217;s labor lost,&#8221; said the old man, slowly, cynically,
but not without emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have ambition,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;No girl was ever
more ambitious, but my ambition is to make the most
and best of myself. Place?&mdash;Jim and I will hold it yet.
Power?&mdash;it shall be as it must be; but Jim and I will
work for it to fulfil ourselves. For me&mdash;ah, if I can save
him&mdash;and I mean to do so!&mdash;do you think that I would
not then have my heaven on earth? You want money&mdash;money&mdash;money,
power, and to rule; and these are to
you the best things in the world. I make my choice
differently, though I would have these other things if I
could; and I hope I shall. But Jim first&mdash;Jim first,
your son, Jim&mdash;my husband, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man got to his feet slowly. She had him at
bay. &#8220;But you are great,&#8221; he said, &#8220;great! It is an
awful stake&mdash;awful! Yet, if you win, you&#8217;ll have what
money can&#8217;t buy. And listen to me. We&#8217;ll make the
stake bigger. It will give it point, too, in another way.
If you keep Jim sober for four years from the day of
your marriage, on the last day of that four years I&#8217;ll put
in your hands for you and him, or for your child&mdash;if you
have one&mdash;five millions of dollars. I am a man of my
word. While Jim drinks I won&#8217;t take him back; he&#8217;s
disinherited. I&#8217;ll give him nothing now or hereafter.
Save him for four years&mdash;if he can do that he will do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
all&mdash;and there&#8217;s five millions as sure as the sun&#8217;s in
heaven. Amen and amen.&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened the door. There was a strange, soft light
in her eyes as she came to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to kiss me?&#8221; she said, looking at
him whimsically.</p>
<p>He was disconcerted. She did not wait, but reached
up and kissed him on the cheek. &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she said,
with a smile. &#8220;We&#8217;ll win the stake. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>An instant and she was gone. He shut the door, then
turned and looked in a mirror on the wall. Abstractedly
he touched the cheek she had kissed. Suddenly a
change passed over his face. He dropped in a chair,
and his fist struck the table as he said: &#8220;By God, she
may do it, she may do it! But it&#8217;s life and death&mdash;it&#8217;s
life and death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Society had its sensation, and then the veil dropped.
For a long time none looked behind it except Jim&#8217;s
father. He had too much at stake not to have his
telescope upon them. A detective followed them to
keep Jim&#8217;s record. But this they did not know.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>From the day they left Washington Jim put his life
and his fate in his wife&#8217;s hands. He meant to follow
her judgment, and, self-willed and strong in intellect as
he was, he said that she should have a fair chance of
fulfilling her purpose. There had been many <i>pour
parlers</i> as to what Jim should do. There was farming.
She set that aside, because it meant capital, and it
also meant monotony and loneliness; and capital was
limited, and monotony and loneliness were bad for Jim,
deadening an active brain which must not be deprived
of stimulants&mdash;stimulants of a different sort, however,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
from those which had heretofore mastered it. There
was the law. But Jim would have to become a citizen
of Canada, change his flag, and where they meant to go&mdash;to
the outskirts&mdash;there would be few opportunities
for the law; and with not enough to <i>do</i> there would be
danger. Railway construction? That seemed good in
many ways, but Jim had not the professional knowledge
necessary; his railway experience with his father had
only been financial. Above all else he must have responsibility,
discipline, and strict order in his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something that will be good for my natural vanity,
and knock the nonsense out of me,&#8221; Jim agreed, as they
drew farther and farther away from Washington and
the past, and nearer and nearer to the Far North and
their future. Never did two more honest souls put
their hands in each other&#8217;s, and set forth upon the
thorniest path to a goal which was their heart&#8217;s desire.
Since they had become one, there had come into Sally&#8217;s
face that illumination which belongs only to souls possessed
of an idea greater than themselves, outside themselves&mdash;saints,
patriots; faces which have been washed
in the salt tears dropped for others&#8217; sorrows and lighted
by the fire of self-sacrifice. Sally Seabrook, the high-spirited,
the radiant, the sweetly wilful, the provoking,
to concentrate herself upon this narrow theme&mdash;to reconquer
the lost paradise of one vexed mortal soul!</p>
<p>What did Jim&#8217;s life mean? It was only one in the
millions coming and going, and every man must work
out his own salvation. Why should she cramp her soul
to this one issue, when the same soul could spend itself
upon the greater motives and in the larger circle? A
wide world of influence had opened up before her;
position, power, adulation, could all have been hers, as
John Appleton and Jim&#8217;s father had said. She might
have moved in well-trodden ways, through gardens of
pleasure, lived a life where all would be made easy, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
she would be shielded at every turn, and her beauty
would be flattered by luxury into a constant glow. She
was not so primitive, so unintellectual, as not to have
thought of this, else her decision would have had less
importance; she would have been no more than an
infatuated, emotional woman with a touch of second-class
drama in her nature. She had thought of it all,
and she had made her choice. The easier course was the
course for meaner souls, and she had not one vein of thin
blood nor a small idea in her whole nature. She had a
heart and mind for great issues. She believed that Jim
had a great brain, and would and could accomplish great
things. She knew that he had in him the strain of
hereditary instinct&mdash;his mother&#8217;s father had ended a
brief life in a drunken duel on the Mississippi, and Jim&#8217;s
boyhood had never had discipline or direction, or any
strenuous order. He might never acquire order, and
the power that order and habit and the daily iteration
of necessary thoughts and acts bring; but the prospect
did not appal her. She had taken the risk with her
eyes wide open; had set her own life and happiness in
the hazard. But Jim must be saved, must be what his
talents, his genius, entitled him to be. And the long
game must have the long thought.</p>
<p>So, as they drew into the great Saskatchewan Valley,
her hand in his, and hope in his eyes, and such a look
of confidence and pride in her as brought back his old,
strong beauty of face and smoothed the careworn lines
of self-indulgence, she gave him his course: as a private
he must join the North-West Mounted Police, the red-coated
riders of the plains, and work his way up through
every stage of responsibility, beginning at the foot of
the ladder of humbleness and self-control. She believed
that he would agree with her proposal; but her hands
clasped his a little more firmly and solicitously&mdash;there
was a faint, womanly fear at her heart&mdash;as she asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
him if he would do it. The life meant more than occasional
separation; it meant that there would be periods
when she would not be with him; and there was great
danger in that; but she knew that the risks must be
taken, and he must not be wholly reliant on her presence
for his moral strength.</p>
<p>His face fell for a moment when she made the suggestion,
but it cleared presently, and he said, with a
dry laugh: &#8220;Well, I guess they must make me a sergeant
pretty quick. I&#8217;m a colonel in the Kentucky
Carbineers!&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed, too; then a moment afterward, womanlike,
wondered if she was right, and was a little frightened.
But that was only because she was not self-opinionated,
and was anxious, more anxious than any woman in all
the North.</p>
<p>It happened as Jim said; he was made a sergeant at
once&mdash;Sally managed that; for, when it came to the
point, she saw the conditions in which the privates
lived, and realized that Jim must be one of them, and
clean out the stables, and groom his horse and the
officers&#8217; horses, and fetch and carry, her heart failed
her, and she thought that she was making her remedy
needlessly heroical. So, she went to see the commissioner,
who was on a tour of scrutiny on their arrival
at the post, and, as better men than he had done in
more knowing circles, he fell under her spell. If she
had asked for a lieutenancy, he would probably have
corrupted some member of Parliament into securing it
for Jim.</p>
<p>But Jim was made a sergeant, and the commissioner
and the captain of the troop kept their eyes on him. So
did other members of the troop who did not quite know
their man, and attempted, figuratively, to pinch him
here and there. They found that his actions were
greater than his words, and both were in perfect harmony
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
in the end, though his words often seemed pointless
to their minds, until they understood that they had
conveyed truths through a medium more like a heliograph
than a telephone. By-and-by they began to
understand his heliographing, and, when they did that,
they began to swear by him, not at him.</p>
<p>In time it was found that the troop never had a better
disciplinarian than Jim. He knew when to shut his
eyes, and when to keep them open. To non-essentials
he kept his eyes shut; to essentials he kept them very
wide open. There were some men of good birth from
England and elsewhere among them, and these mostly
understood him first. But they all understood Sally
from the beginning, and after a little they were glad
enough to be permitted to come, on occasion, to the
five-roomed little house near the barracks, and hear
her talk, then answer her questions, and, as men had
done at Washington, open out their hearts to her. They
noticed, however, that while she made them barley-water,
and all kinds of soft drinks from citric acid,
sarsaparilla, and the like, and had one special drink of
her own invention, which she called cream-nectar, no
spirits were to be had. They also noticed that Jim
never drank a drop of liquor, and by-and-by, one way
or another, they got a glimmer of the real truth, before
it became known who he really was or anything of his
story. And the interest in the two, and in Jim&#8217;s reformation,
spread through the country, while Jim gained
reputation as the smartest man in the force.</p>
<p>They were on the outskirts of civilization&mdash;as Jim
used to say, &#8220;One step ahead of the procession.&#8221; Jim&#8217;s
duty was to guard the columns of settlement and progress,
and to see that every man got his own rights and
not more than his rights; that justice should be the
plumb-line of march and settlement. His principle was
embodied in certain words which he quoted once to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Sally from the prophet Amos&mdash;&#8220;<i>And the Lord said
unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the day that Jim became a lieutenant his family
increased by one. It was a girl, and they called her
Nancy, after Jim&#8217;s mother. It was the anniversary of
their marriage, and, so far, Jim had won, with what
fightings and strugglings and wrestlings of the spirit only
Sally and himself knew. And she knew as well as he,
and always saw the storm coming before it broke&mdash;a
restlessness, then a moodiness, then a hungry, eager,
helpless look, and afterward an agony of longing, a
feverish desire to break away and get the thrilling thing
which would still the demon within him.</p>
<p>There had been moments when his doom seemed
certain&mdash;he knew and she knew that if he once got
drunk again he would fall never to rise. On one occasion,
after a hard, long, hungry ride, he was half-mad
with desire, but even as he seized the flask that was
offered to him by his only enemy, the captain of B
Troop, at the next station eastward, there came a sudden
call to duty, two hundred Indians having gone upon
the war-path. It saved him, it broke the spell. He
had to mount and away, with the antidote and stimulant
of responsibility driving him on.</p>
<p>Another occasion was equally perilous to his safety.
They had been idle for days in a hot week in summer,
waiting for orders to return from the rail-head where
they had gone to quell a riot, and where drink and
hilarity were common. Suddenly&mdash;more suddenly than
it had ever come, the demon of his thirst had Jim by
the throat. Sergeant Sewell, of the gray-stubble head,
who loved him more than his sour heart had loved
anybody in all his life, was holding himself ready for
the physical assault he must make upon his superior
officer if he raised a glass to his lips, when salvation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
came once again. An accident had occurred far down
on the railway line, and the operator of the telegraph-office
had that very day been stricken down with
pleurisy and pneumonia. In despair the manager had
sent to Jim, eagerly hoping that he might help them,
for the Riders of the Plains were a sort of court of
appeal for every trouble in the Far North.</p>
<p>Instantly Jim was in the saddle with his troop. Out
of curiosity he had learned telegraphy when a boy, as
he had learned many things, and, arrived at the scene
of the accident, he sent messages and received them&mdash;by
sound, not on paper as did the official operator, to
the amazement and pride of the troop. Then, between
caring for the injured in the accident, against the coming
of the relief train, and nursing the sick operator through
the dark moments of his dangerous illness, he passed a
crisis of his own disease triumphantly; but not the last
crisis.</p>
<p>So the first and so the second and third years passed
in safety.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>III</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Please, I want to go, too, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim swung round and caught the child up in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, how dare you call your father <i>Jim</i>&mdash;eh, tell
me that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what mummy calls you&mdash;it&#8217;s pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t call her &#8216;mummy&#8217; because you do, and you
mustn&#8217;t call me <i>Jim</i> because she does&mdash;do you hear?&#8221;</p>
<p>The whimsical face lowered a little, then the rare and
beautiful dark blue eyes raised slowly, shaded by the
long lashes, and the voice said, demurely, &#8220;Yes&mdash;Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nancy&mdash;Nancy,&#8221; said a voice from the corner in
reproof, mingled with suppressed laughter. &#8220;Nancy,
you mustn&#8217;t be saucy. You must say &#8216;father&#8217; to&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mummy. I&#8217;ll say father to&mdash;Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You imp&mdash;you imp of delight,&#8221; said Jim, as he
strained the dainty little lass to his breast, while she
appeared interested in a wave of his black hair, which
she curled around her finger.</p>
<p>Sally came forward with the little parcel of sandwiches
she had been preparing, and put them in the saddlebags
lying on a chair at the door, in readiness for the
journey Jim was about to make. Her eyes were glistening,
and her face had a heightened color. The three
years which had passed since she married had touched
her not at all to her disadvantage, rather to her profit.
She looked not an hour older; motherhood had only
added to her charm, lending it a delightful gravity.
The prairie life had given a shining quality to her handsomeness,
an air of depth and firmness, an exquisite
health and clearness to the color in her cheeks. Her
step was as light as Nancy&#8217;s, elastic and buoyant&mdash;a
gliding motion which gave a sinuous grace to the movements
of her body. There had also come into her eyes
a vigilance such as deaf people possess, a sensitive observation
imparting a deeper intelligence to the face.</p>
<p>Here was the only chance by which you could guess
the story of her life. Her eyes were like the ears of an
anxious mother who can never sleep till every child is
abed; whose sense is quick to hear the faintest footstep
without or within; and who, as years go on, and her
children grow older and older, must still lie awake
hearkening for the late footstep on the stair. In Sally&#8217;s
eyes was the story of the past three years: of love and
temptation and struggle, of watchfulness and yearning
and anxiety, of determination and an inviolable hope.
Her eyes had a deeper look than that in Jim&#8217;s. Now,
as she gazed at him, the maternal spirit rose up from
the great well of protectiveness in her and engulfed
both husband and child. There was always something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
of the maternal in her eyes when she looked at Jim.
He did not see it&mdash;he saw only the wonderful blue, and
the humor which had helped him over such difficult
places these past three years. In steadying and strengthening
Jim&#8217;s will, in developing him from his Southern
indolence into Northern industry and sense of responsibility,
John Appleton&#8217;s warnings had rung in Sally&#8217;s
ears, and Freddy Hartzman&#8217;s forceful and high-minded
personality had passed before her eyes with an appeal
powerful and stimulating; but always she came to the
same upland of serene faith and white-hearted resolve;
and Jim became dearer and dearer.</p>
<p>The baby had done much to brace her faith in the
future and comfort her anxious present. The child had
intelligence of a rare order. She would lie by the half-hour
on the floor, turning over the leaves of a book without
pictures, and, before she could speak, would read
from the pages in a language all her own. She made a
fairy world for herself, peopled by characters to whom
she gave names, to whom she assigned curious attributes
and qualities. They were as real to her as though flesh
and blood, and she was never lonely, and never cried;
and she had buried herself in her father&#8217;s heart. She
had drawn to her the roughest men in the troop, and
for old Sewell, the grim sergeant, she had a specially
warm place.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can love me if you like,&#8221; she had said to him
at the very start, with the egotism of childhood; but
made haste to add, &#8220;because I love you, Gri-Gri.&#8221; She
called him Gri-Gri from the first, but they knew only
long afterward that &#8220;gri-gri&#8221; meant &#8220;gray-gray,&#8221; to
signify that she called him after his grizzled hairs.</p>
<p>What she had been in the life-history of Sally and
Jim they both knew. Jim regarded her with an almost
superstitious feeling. Sally was his strength, his support,
his inspiration, his bulwark of defence; Nancy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
was the charm he wore about his neck&mdash;his mascot, he
called her. Once, when she was ill, he had suffered as
he had never done before in his life. He could not
sleep nor eat, and went about his duties like one in a
dream. When his struggles against his enemy were
fiercest, he kept saying over her name to himself, as
though she could help him. Yet always it was Sally&#8217;s
hand he held in the darkest hours, in his brutal moments;
for in this fight between appetite and will there
are moments when only the animal seems to exist, and
the soul disappears in the glare and gloom of the primal
emotions. Nancy he called his &#8220;lucky sixpence,&#8221; but
he called Sally his &#8220;guinea-girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>From first to last his whimsicality never deserted him.
In his worst hours, some innate optimism and humor
held him steady in his fight. It was not depression that
possessed him at the worst, but the violence of an
appetite most like a raging pain which men may endure
with a smile upon their lips. He carried in his face the
story of a conflict, the aftermath of bitter experience;
and through all there pulsed the glow of experience.
He had grown handsomer, and the graceful decision of
his figure, the deliberate certainty of every action,
heightened the force of a singular personality. As in
the eyes of Sally, in his eyes was a long, reflective look
which told of things overcome, and yet of dangers
present. His lips smiled often, but the eyes said: &#8220;I
have lived, I have seen, I have suffered, and I must
suffer more. I have loved, I have been loved under
the shadow of the sword. Happiness I have had, and
golden hours, but not peace&mdash;never peace. My soul
has need of peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the greater, deeper experience of their lives, the
more material side of existence had grown less and less
to them. Their home was a model of simple comfort
and some luxury, though Jim had insisted that Sally&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
income should not be spent, except upon the child, and
should be saved for the child, their home being kept on
his pay and on the tiny income left by his mother.
With the help of an Indian girl, and a half-breed for
out-door work and fires and gardening, Sally had cared
for the house herself. Ingenious and tasteful, with a
gift for cooking and an educated hand, she had made
her little home as pretty as their few possessions would
permit. Refinement covered all, and three or four
score books were like so many friends to comfort her
when Jim was away; like kind and genial neighbors
when he was at home. From Browning she had written
down in her long, sliding handwriting, and hung up beneath
Jim&#8217;s looking-glass, the heartening and inspiring
words:</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>They had lived above the sordid, and there was
something in the nature of Jim&#8217;s life to help them to it.
He belonged to a small handful of men who had control
over an empire, with an individual responsibility
and influence not contained in the scope of their commissions.
It was a matter of moral force and character,
and of uniform, symbolical only of the great power behind;
of the long arm of the State; of the insistence of
the law, which did not rely upon force alone, but on
the certainty of its administration. In such conditions
the smallest brain was bound to expand, to take on
qualities of judgment and temperateness which would
never be developed in ordinary circumstances. In the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
case of Jim Templeton, who needed no stimulant to his
intellect, but rather a steadying quality, a sense of proportion,
the daily routine, the command of men, the
diverse nature of his duties, half civil, half military, the
personal appeals made on all sides by the people of the
country for advice, for help, for settlement of disputes,
for information which his well-instructed mind could
give&mdash;all these modified the romantic brilliance of his
intellect, made it and himself more human.</p>
<p>It had not come to him all at once. His intellect at
first stood in his way. His love of paradox, his deep
observation, his insight&mdash;all made him inherently satirical,
though not cruelly so; but satire had become pure
whimsicality at last; and he came to see that, on the
whole, the world was imperfect, but also, on the whole,
was moving toward perfection rather than imperfection.
He grew to realize that what seemed so often weakness
in men was tendency and idiosyncrasy rather than evil.
And in the end he thought better of himself as he came
to think better of all others. For he had thought less
of all the world because he had thought so little of himself.
He had overestimated his own faults, had made
them into crimes in his own eyes, and, observing things
in others of similar import, had become almost a cynic
in intellect, while in heart he had remained a boy.</p>
<p>In all that he had changed a great deal. His heart
was still the heart of a boy, but his intellect had sobered,
softened, ripened&mdash;even in this secluded and seemingly
unimportant life; as Sally had said and hoped it would.
Sally&#8217;s conviction had been right. But the triumph was
not yet achieved. She knew it. On occasion the tones
of his voice told her, the look that came into his eyes
proclaimed it to her, his feverishness and restlessness
made it certain. How many a night had she thrown
her arm over his shoulder, and sought his hand and held
it while in the dark silence, wide-eyed, dry-lipped, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
with a throat like fire he had held himself back from
falling. There was liquor in the house&mdash;the fight would
not have been a fight without it. She had determined
that he should see his enemy and meet him in the plains
and face him down; and he was never many feet away
from his possible disaster. Yet for long over three years
all had gone well. There was another year. Would he
last out the course?</p>
<p>At first the thought of the great stake for which she
was playing in terms of currency, with the head of Jim&#8217;s
father on every note, was much with her. The amazing
nature of the offer of five millions of dollars stimulated
her imagination, roused her; gold coins are counters in
the game of success, signs and tokens. Money alone
could not have lured her; but rather what it represented&mdash;power,
width of action, freedom to help when the
heart prompted, machinery for carrying out large plans,
ability to surround with advantage those whom we love.
So, at first, while yet the memories of Washington were
much with her, the appeal of the millions was strong.
The gallant nature of the contest and the great stake
braced her; she felt the blood quicken in her pulse.</p>
<p>But, all through, the other thing really mastered her:
the fixed idea that Jim must be saved. As it deepened,
the other life that she had lived became like the sports
in which we shared when children, full of vivacious
memory, shining with impulse and the stir of life, but
not to be repeated&mdash;days and deeds outgrown. So the
light of one idea shone in her face. Yet she was intensely
human too; and if her eyes had not been set
on the greater glory, the other thought might have
vulgarized her mind, made her end and goal sordid&mdash;the
descent of a nature rather than its ascension.</p>
<p>When Nancy came, the lesser idea, the stake, took on
a new importance, for now it seemed to her that it was
her duty to secure for the child its rightful heritage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Then Jim, too, appeared in a new light, as one who
could never fulfil himself unless working through the
natural channels of his birth, inheritance, and upbringing.
Jim, drunken and unreliable, with broken will
and fighting to find himself&mdash;the waste places were for
him, until he was the master of his will and emotions.
Once, however, secure in ability to control himself, with
cleansed brain and purpose defined, the widest field
would be still be too narrow for his talents&mdash;and the
five, yes, the fifty millions of his father must be his.</p>
<p>She had never repented having married Jim; but
twice in those three years she had broken down and
wept as though her heart would break. There were
times when Jim&#8217;s nerves were shaken in his struggle
against the unseen foe, and he had spoken to her querulously,
almost sharply. Yet in her tears there was no
reproach for him, rather for herself&mdash;the fear that she
might lose her influence over him, that she could not
keep him close to her heart, that he might drift away
from her in the commonplaces and monotony of work
and domestic life. Everything so depended on her
being to him not only the one woman for whom he
cared, but the woman without whom he could care for
nothing else.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, my God, give me his love,&#8221; she had prayed.
&#8220;Let me keep it yet a little while. For his sake, not
for my own, let me have the power to hold his love.
Make my mind always quiet, and let me blow neither
hot nor cold. Help me to keep my temper sweet and
cheerful, so that he will find the room empty where I
am not, and his footsteps will quicken when he comes
to the door. Not for my sake, dear God, but for his,
or my heart will break&mdash;it will break unless Thou dost
help me to hold him. O Lord, keep me from tears;
make my face happy that I may be goodly to his eyes,
and forgive the selfishness of a poor woman who has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
little, and would keep her little and cherish it, for Christ&#8217;s
sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twice had she poured out her heart so, in the agony
of her fear that she should lose favor in Jim&#8217;s sight&mdash;she
did not know how alluring she was, in spite of the
constant proofs offered her. She had had her will with
all who came her way, from Governor to Indian brave.
Once, in a journey they had made far north, soon after
they came, she had stayed at a Hudson Bay Company&#8217;s
post for some days, while there came news of
restlessness among the Indians, because of lack of food,
and Jim had gone farther north to steady the tribes,
leaving her with the factor and his wife and a half-breed
servant.</p>
<p>While she and the factor&#8217;s wife were alone in the
yard of the post one day, an Indian chief, Arrowhead,
in war-paint and feathers, entered suddenly, brandishing
a long knife. He had been drinking, and there was
danger in his black eyes. With a sudden inspiration
she came forward quickly, nodded and smiled to him,
and then pointed to a grindstone standing in the corner
of the yard. As she did so, she saw Indians crowding
into the gate armed with knives, guns, bows, and
arrows. She beckoned to Arrowhead, and he followed
her to the grindstone. She poured some water on the
wheel and began to turn it, nodding at the now impassive
Indian to begin. Presently he nodded also,
and put his knife on the stone. She kept turning
steadily, singing to herself the while, as with anxiety
she saw the Indians drawing closer and closer in from
the gate. Faster and faster she turned, and at last the
Indian lifted his knife from the stone. She reached
out her hand with simulated interest, felt the edge with
her thumb, the Indian looking darkly at her the while.
Presently, after feeling the edge himself, he bent over
the stone again, and she went on turning the wheel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
still singing softly. At last he stopped again and felt
the edge. With a smile which showed her fine, white
teeth, she said, &#8220;Is that for me?&#8221; making a significant
sign across her throat at the same time.</p>
<p>The old Indian looked at her grimly, then slowly
shook his head in negation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I go hunt Yellow Hawk to-night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I go
fight; I like marry you when I come back. <i>How</i>!&#8221; he
said, and turned away toward the gate.</p>
<p>Some of his braves held back, the blackness of death
in their looks. He saw. &#8220;My knife is sharp,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;The woman is brave. She shall live&mdash;go and fight
Yellow Hawk, or starve and die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Divining their misery, their hunger, and the savage
thought that had come to them, Sally had whispered to
the factor&#8217;s wife to bring food, and the woman now came
running out with two baskets full, and returned for
more. Sally ran forward among the Indians and put
the food into their hands. With grunts of satisfaction
they seized what she gave, and thrust it into their
mouths, squatting on the ground. Arrowhead looked
on stern and immobile, but when at last she and the
factor&#8217;s wife sat down before the braves with confidence
and an air of friendliness, he sat down also; yet, famished
as he was, he would not touch the food. At last Sally,
realizing his proud defiance of hunger, offered him a
little lump of pemmican and a biscuit, and with a grunt
he took it from her hands and ate it. Then, at his
command, a fire was lit, the pipe of peace was brought
out, and Sally and the factor&#8217;s wife touched their lips
to it, and passed it on.</p>
<p>So was a new treaty of peace and loyalty made with
Arrowhead and his tribe by a woman without fear,
whose life had seemed not worth a minute&#8217;s purchase;
and, as the sun went down, Arrowhead and his men
went forth to make war upon Yellow Hawk beside the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
Nettigon River. In this wise had her influence spread
in the land.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Standing now with the child in his arms and his wife
looking at him with a shining moisture of the eyes, Jim
laughed outright. There came upon him a sudden
sense of power, of aggressive force&mdash;the will to do.
Sally understood, and came and laughingly grasped his
arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim,&#8221; she said, playfully, &#8220;you are getting
muscles like steel. You hadn&#8217;t these when you were
colonel of the Kentucky Carbineers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I need them now,&#8221; he said, smiling, and
with the child still in his arms drew her to a window
looking northward. As far as the eye could see, nothing
but snow, like a blanket spread over the land.
Here and there in the wide expanse a tree silhouetted
against the sky, a tracery of eccentric beauty, and off in
the far distance a solitary horseman riding toward the
post&mdash;riding hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was root, hog, or die with me, Sally,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and I rooted.... I wonder&mdash;that fellow on the
horse&mdash;I have a feeling about him. See, he&#8217;s been riding
hard and long&mdash;you can tell by the way the horse drops
his legs. He sags a bit himself.... But isn&#8217;t it beautiful,
all that out there&mdash;the real quintessence of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The air was full of delicate particles of frost on which
the sun sparkled, and though there was neither bird nor
insect, nor animal, nor stir of leaf, nor swaying branch
or waving grass, life palpitated in the air, energy sang
its song in the footstep that crunched the frosty ground,
that broke the crusted snow; it was in the delicate
wind that stirred the flag by the barracks away to the
left; hope smiled in the wide prospect over which the
thrilling, bracing air trembled. Sally had chosen right.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had a big thought when you brought me here,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
guinea-girl,&#8221; he added, presently. &#8220;We are going to
win out here&#8221;&mdash;he set the child down&mdash;&#8220;you and I and
this lucky sixpence.&#8221; He took up his short fur coat.
&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll win, honey.&#8221; Then, with a brooding look
in his face, he added:</p>

<p>He paused reflectively. &#8220;It&#8217;s strange that this life
up here makes you feel that you must live a bigger life
still, that this is only the wide porch to the great labor-house&mdash;it
makes you want to do things. Well, we&#8217;ve
got to win the stake first,&#8221; he added, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stake is a big one, Jim&mdash;bigger than you think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You and her and me&mdash;me that was in the gutter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the gutter, dadsie?&#8221; asked Nancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gutter&mdash;the gutter is where the dish-water goes,
midget,&#8221; he answered, with a dry laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d like to be in the gutter,&#8221;
Nancy said, solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to get used to it first, miss,&#8221; answered
Jim. Suddenly Sally laid both hands on Jim&#8217;s shoulders
and looked him in the eyes. &#8220;You must win the stake,
Jim. Think&mdash;now!&#8221;</p>
<p>She laid a hand on the head of the child. He did
not know that he was playing for a certain five millions,
perhaps fifty millions, of dollars. She had never told
him of his father&#8217;s offer. He was fighting only for
salvation, for those he loved, for freedom. As they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
stood there, the conviction had come upon her that
they had come to the last battle-field, that this journey
which Jim now must take would decide all, would give
them perfect peace or lifelong pain. The shadow of
battle was over them, but he had no foreboding, no
premonition; he had never been so full of spirits and life.</p>
<p>To her adjuration Jim replied by burying his face in
her golden hair, and he whispered: &#8220;Say, I&#8217;ve done
near four years, my girl. I think I&#8217;m all right now&mdash;I
think. This last six months, it&#8217;s been easy&mdash;pretty
fairly easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four months more, only four months more&mdash;God be
good to us!&#8221; she said, with a little gasp.</p>
<p>If he held out for four months more, the first great
stage in their life-journey would be passed, the stake won.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a woman get an awful fall once,&#8221; Jim said,
suddenly. &#8220;Her bones were broken in twelve places,
and there wasn&#8217;t a spot on her body without injury.
They set and fixed up every broken bone except one. It
was split down. They didn&#8217;t dare perform the operation;
she couldn&#8217;t stand it. There was a limit to pain,
and she had reached the boundary. Two years went
by, and she got better every way, but inside her leg
those broken pieces of bone were rubbing against each
other. She tried to avoid the inevitable operation, but
Nature said, &#8216;You must do it, or die in the end.&#8217; She
yielded. Then came the long preparations for the operation.
Her heart shrank, her mind got tortured. She&#8217;d
suffered too much. She pulled herself together, and
said, &#8216;I must conquer this shrinking body of mine by
my will. How shall I do it?&#8217; Something within her
said, &#8216;Think and do for others. Forget yourself.&#8217; And
so, as they got her ready for her torture, she visited
hospitals, agonized cripple as she was, and smiled and
talked to the sick and broken, telling them of her own
miseries endured and dangers faced, of the boundary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
of human suffering almost passed; and so she got her
courage for her own trial. And she came out all right
in the end. Well, that&#8217;s the way I&#8217;ve felt sometimes.
But I&#8217;m ready for my operation now whenever it comes,
and it&#8217;s coming, I know. Let it come when it must.&#8221;
He smiled.</p>
<p>There came a knock at the door, and presently Sewell
entered. &#8220;The Commissioner wishes you to come over,
sir,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just coming, Sewell. Is all ready for the start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s ready, sir, but there&#8217;s to be a change of
orders. Something&#8217;s happened&mdash;a bad job up in the
Cree country, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Jim was in the Commissioner&#8217;s
office. The murder of a Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company&#8217;s man
had been committed in the Cree country. The stranger
whom Jim and Sally had seen riding across the plains
had brought the news for thirty miles, word of the
murder having been carried from point to point. The
Commissioner was uncertain what to do, as the Crees
were restless through want of food and the absence of
game, and a force sent to capture Arrowhead, the chief
who had committed the murder, might precipitate
trouble. Jim solved the problem by offering to go
alone and bring the chief into the post. It was two
hundred miles to the Cree encampment, and the journey
had its double dangers.</p>
<p>Another officer was sent on the expedition for which
Jim had been preparing, and he made ready to go upon
his lonely duty. His wife did not know till three days
after he had gone what the nature of his mission was.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>IV</p>
</div>

<p>Jim made his journey in good weather with his
faithful dogs alone, and came into the camp of the Crees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
armed with only a revolver. If he had gone with ten
men, there would have been an instant mêlée, in which
he would have lost his life. This is what the chief had
expected, had prepared for; but Jim was more formidable
alone, with power far behind him which could come
with force and destroy the tribe, if resistance was offered,
than with fifty men. His tongue had a gift of terse
and picturesque speech, powerful with a people who had
the gift of imagination. With five hundred men ready
to turn him loose in the plains without dogs or food, he
carried himself with a watchful coolness and complacent
determination which got home to their minds with
great force.</p>
<p>For hours the struggle for the murderer went on, a
struggle of mind over inferior mind and matter.</p>
<p>Arrowhead was a chief whose will had never been
crossed by his own people, and to master that will by a
superior will, to hold back the destructive force which,
to the ignorant minds of the braves, was only a natural
force of defence, meant a task needing more than authority
behind it. For the very fear of that authority
put in motion was an incentive to present resistance&mdash;to
stave off the day of trouble. The faces that surrounded
Jim were thin with hunger, and the murder that
had been committed by the chief had, as its origin, the
foolish replies of the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company&#8217;s man to
their demand for supplies. Arrowhead had killed him
with his own hand.</p>
<p>But Jim Templeton was of a different calibre. Although
he had not been told it, he realized that, indirectly,
hunger was the cause of the crime and might
easily become the cause of another; for their tempers
were sharper even than their appetites. Upon this he
played; upon this he made an exhortation to the chief.
He assumed that Arrowhead had become violent because
of his people&#8217;s straits, that Arrowhead&#8217;s heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
yearned for his people and would make sacrifice for
them. Now, if Arrowhead came quietly, he would see
that supplies of food were sent at once, and that arrangements
were made to meet the misery of their situation.
Therefore, if Arrowhead came freely, he would have so
much in his favor before his judges; if he would not
come quietly, then he must be brought by force; and
if they raised a hand to prevent it, then destruction
would fall upon all&mdash;all save the women and children.
The law must be obeyed. They might try to resist the
law through him, but, if violence was shown, he would
first kill Arrowhead, and then destruction would descend
like a wind out of the north, darkness would swallow
them, and their bones would cover the plains.</p>
<p>As he ended his words a young brave sprang forward
with hatchet raised. Jim&#8217;s revolver slipped down into
his palm from his sleeve, and a bullet caught the brave
in the lifted arm. The hatchet dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>Then Jim&#8217;s eyes blazed, and he turned a look of
anger on the chief, his face pale and hard, as he said:
&#8220;The stream rises above the banks; come with me,
chief, or all will drown. I am master, and I speak. Ye
are hungry because ye are idle. Ye call the world
yours, yet ye will not stoop to gather from the earth
the fruits of the earth. Ye sit idle in the summer, and
women and children die round you when winter comes.
Because the game is gone, ye say. Must the world
stand still because a handful of Crees need a hunting-ground?
Must the makers of cities and the wonders
of the earth, who fill the land with plenty&mdash;must they
stand far off, because the Crees and their chief would
wander over a million acres, for each man a million,
when by a hundred&mdash;ay, by ten&mdash;each white man would
live in plenty and make the land rejoice? See! Here
is the truth. When the Great Spirit draws the game
away so that the hunting is poor, ye sit down and fill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
your hearts with murder, and in the blackness of your
thoughts kill my brother. Idle and shiftless and evil
ye are, while the earth cries out to give you of its plenty,
a great harvest from a little seed, if ye will but dig
and plant, and plough and sow and reap, and lend
your backs to toil. Now hear and heed. The end is
come. For this once ye shall be fed&mdash;by the blood of
my heart, ye shall be fed! And another year ye shall
labor, and get the fruits of your labor, and not stand
waiting, as it were, till a fish shall pass the spear or a
stag water at your door, that ye may slay and eat.
The end is come, ye idle men. O chief, hearken! One
of your braves would have slain me, even as you slew
my brother&mdash;he one, and you a thousand. Speak to
your people as I have spoken, and then come and answer
for the deed done by your hand. And this I say
that right shall be done between men and men. Speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim had made his great effort, and not without avail.
Arrowhead rose slowly, the cloud gone out of his face,
and spoke to his people, bidding them wait in peace
until food came, and appointing his son chief in his
stead until his return.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white man speaks truth, and I will go,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I shall return,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if it be written
so upon the leaves of the Tree of Life; and if it be not
so written, I shall fade like a mist, and the tepees will
know me not again. The days of my youth are spent,
and my step no longer springs from the ground. I
shuffle among the grass and the fallen leaves, and my
eyes scarce know the stag from the doe. The white
man is master&mdash;if he wills it we shall die; if he wills it
we shall live. And this was ever so. It is in the tale
of our people. One tribe ruled, and the others were
their slaves. If it is written on the leaves of the Tree
of Life that the white man rule us forever, then it shall
be so, I have spoken. Now, behold, I go.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>Jim had conquered, and together they sped away
with the dogs through the sweet-smelling spruce woods
where every branch carried a cloth of white, and the
only sound heard was the swish of a blanket of snow
as it fell to the ground from the wide webs of green, or
a twig snapped under the load it bore. Peace brooded
in the silent and comforting forest, and Jim and Arrowhead,
the Indian ever ahead, swung along, mile after
mile, on their snow-shoes, emerging at last upon the
wide, white prairie.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A hundred miles of sun and fair weather, sleeping at
night in the open in a trench dug in the snow, no fear
in the thoughts of Jim, nor evil in the heart of the
heathen man. There had been moments of watchfulness,
of uncertainty, on Jim&#8217;s part, the first few hours of
the first night after they left the Cree reservation; but
the conviction speedily came to Jim that all was well;
for the chief slept soundly from the moment he lay
down in his blankets between the dogs. Then Jim
went to sleep as in his own bed, and, waking, found
Arrowhead lighting a fire from a little load of sticks
from the sledges. And between murderer and captor
there sprang up the companionship of the open road
which brings all men to a certain land of faith and
understanding, unless they are perverted and vile.
There was no vileness in Arrowhead. There were no
handcuffs on his hands, no sign of captivity; they two
ate out of the same dish, drank from the same basin,
broke from the same bread. The crime of Arrowhead,
the gallows waiting for him, seemed very far away.
They were only two silent travellers, sharing the same
hardship, helping to give material comfort to each
other&mdash;in the inevitable democracy of those far places,
where small things are not great nor great things small;
where into men&#8217;s hearts comes the knowledge of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
things that matter; where, from the wide, starry sky,
from the august loneliness, and the soul of the life
which has brooded there for untold generations, God
teaches the values of this world and the next.</p>
<p>One hundred miles of sun and fair weather, and then
fifty miles of bitter, aching cold, with nights of peril
from the increasing chill, so that Jim dared not sleep
lest he should never wake again, but die benumbed and
exhausted! Yet Arrowhead slept through all. Day
after day so, and then ten miles of storm such as come
only to the vast barrens of the northlands; and woe to
the traveller upon whom the icy wind and the blinding
snow descended! Woe came upon Jim Templeton and
Arrowhead, the heathen.</p>
<p>In the awful struggle between man and nature that
followed, the captive became the leader. The craft of
the plains, the inherent instinct, the feeling which was
more than eyesight became the only hope. One whole
day to cover ten miles&mdash;an endless path of agony, in
which Jim went down again and again, but came up
blinded by snow and drift, and cut as with lashes by
the angry wind. At the end of the ten miles was a
Hudson Bay Company&#8217;s post and safety; and through
ten hours had the two struggled toward it, going off at
tangents, circling on their own tracks; but the Indian,
by an instinct as sure as the needle to the pole, getting
the direction to the post again, in the moments of
direst peril and uncertainty. To Jim the world became
a sea of maddening forces which buffeted him; a whirlpool
of fire in which his brain was tortured, his mind
was shrivelled up; a vast army rending itself, each man
against the other. It was a purgatory of music, broken
by discords; and then at last&mdash;how sweet it all was,
after the eternity of misery!&mdash;&#8220;Church bells and voices
low,&#8221; and Sally singing to him, Nancy&#8217;s voice calling!
Then, nothing but sleep&mdash;sleep, a sinking down millions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
of miles in an ether of drowsiness which thrilled him;
and after&mdash;no more.</p>
<p>None who has suffered up to the limit of what the
human body and soul may bear can remember the
history of those distracted moments when the struggle
became one between the forces in nature and the forces
in man, between agonized body and smothered mind,
yet with the divine intelligence of the created being
directing, even though subconsciously, the fight.</p>
<p>How Arrowhead found the post in the mad storm he
could never have told. Yet he found it, with Jim unconscious
on the sledge and with limbs frozen, all the
dogs gone but two, the leathers over the Indian&#8217;s shoulders
as he fell against the gate of the post with a shrill
cry that roused the factor and his people within, together
with Sergeant Sewell, who had been sent out
from headquarters to await Jim&#8217;s arrival there. It was
Sewell&#8217;s hand which first felt Jim&#8217;s heart and pulse,
and found that there was still life left, even before it
could be done by the doctor from headquarters, who
had come to visit a sick man at the post.</p>
<p>For hours they worked with snow upon the frozen
limbs to bring back life and consciousness. Consciousness
came at last with half delirium, half understanding;
as, emerging from the passing sleep of anæsthetics, the
eye sees things and dimly registers them before the
brain has set them in any relation to life or comprehension.</p>
<p>But Jim was roused at last, and the doctor presently
held to his lips a glass of brandy. Then from infinite distance
Jim&#8217;s understanding returned; the mind emerged,
but not wholly, from the chaos in which it was travelling.
His eyes stood out in eagerness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brandy! brandy!&#8221; he said, hungrily.</p>
<p>With an oath Sewell snatched the glass from the
doctor&#8217;s hand, put it on the table, then stooped to Jim&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
ear and said, hoarsely: &#8220;Remember&mdash;Nancy. For God&#8217;s
sake, sir, don&#8217;t drink!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s head fell back, the fierce light went out of his
eyes, the face became grayer and sharper. &#8220;Sally&mdash;Nancy&mdash;Nancy,&#8221;
he whispered, and his fingers clutched
vaguely at the quilt.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have brandy or he will die. The system
is pumped out. He must be revived,&#8221; said the doctor.
He reached again for the glass of spirits.</p>
<p>Jim understood now. He was on the borderland
between life and death, his feet were at the brink.
&#8220;No&mdash;not&mdash;brandy, no!&#8221; he moaned. &#8220;Sally&mdash;Sally,
kiss me,&#8221; he said, faintly, from the middle world in
which he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, the broth!&#8221; said Sewell to the factor, who
had been preparing it. &#8220;Quick, while there&#8217;s a chance.&#8221;
He stooped and called into Jim&#8217;s ear: &#8220;For the love of
God, wake up, sir. They&#8217;re coming&mdash;they&#8217;re both coming&mdash;Nancy&#8217;s
coming. They&#8217;ll soon be here.&#8221; What
matter that he lied?&mdash;a life was at stake.</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s eyes opened again. The doctor was standing
with the brandy in his hand. Half madly Jim reached
out. &#8220;I must live until they come,&#8221; he cried; &#8220;the
brandy&mdash;ah, give it! Give it&mdash;ah, no, no, I must not,&#8221;
he added, gasping, his lips trembling, his hands shaking.</p>
<p>Sewell held the broth to his lips. He drank a little,
yet his face became grayer and grayer; a bluish tinge
spread about his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you nothing else, sir?&#8221; asked Sewell, in despair.</p>
<p>The doctor put down the brandy, went quickly to
his medicine-case, dropped into a glass some liquid from
a phial, came over again, and poured a little between
the lips; then a little more, as Jim&#8217;s eyes opened again;
and at last every drop in the glass trickled down the
sinewy throat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>Presently as they watched him the doctor said: &#8220;It
will not do. He must have brandy. It has life&mdash;food&mdash;in
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim understood the words. He knew that if he
drank the brandy the chances against his future were
terrible. He had made his vow, and he must keep it.
Yet the thirst was on him; his enemy had him by the
throat again, was dragging him down. Though his
body was so cold, his throat was on fire. But in the
extremity of his strength his mind fought on&mdash;fought
on, growing weaker every moment. He was having his
last fight. They watched him with an aching anxiety,
and there was anger in the doctor&#8217;s face. He had no
patience with these forces arrayed against him.</p>
<p>At last the doctor whispered to Sewell, &#8220;It&#8217;s no use;
he must have the brandy, or he can&#8217;t live an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sewell weakened; the tears fell down his rough, hard
cheeks. &#8220;It&#8217;ll ruin him&mdash;it&#8217;s ruin or death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust a little more in God and in the man&#8217;s strength.
Let us give him the chance. Force it down his throat&mdash;he&#8217;s
not responsible,&#8221; said the physician, to whom saving
life was more than all else.</p>
<p>Suddenly there appeared at the bedside Arrowhead,
gaunt and weak, his face swollen, the skin of it broken
by the whips of storm.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is my brother,&#8221; he said, and, stooping, laid both
hands, which he had held before the fire for a long
time, on Jim&#8217;s heart. &#8220;Take his feet, his hands, his
legs, and his head in your hands,&#8221; he said to them all.
&#8220;Life is in us; we will give him life.&#8221;</p>
<p>He knelt down and kept both hands on Jim&#8217;s heart,
while the others, even the doctor, awed by his act, did as
they were bidden. &#8220;Shut your eyes. Let your life go
into him. Think of him, and him alone. Now!&#8221; said
Arrowhead, in a strange voice.</p>
<p>He murmured, and continued murmuring, his body
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
drawing closer and closer to Jim&#8217;s body, while in the
deep silence, broken only by the chanting of his low,
monotonous voice, the others pressed Jim&#8217;s hands and
head and feet and legs&mdash;six men under the command
of a heathen murderer.</p>
<p>The minutes passed. The color came back to Jim&#8217;s
face, the skin of his hands filled up, they ceased twitching,
his pulse got stronger, his eyes opened with a new
light in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m living, anyhow,&#8221; he said, at last, with a faint
smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry&mdash;broth, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fight was won, and Arrowhead, the pagan murderer,
drew over to the fire and crouched down beside
it, his back to the bed, impassive and still. They
brought him a bowl of broth and bread, which he drank
slowly, and placed the empty bowl between his knees.
He sat there through the night, though they tried to
make him lie down.</p>
<p>As the light came in at the windows, Sewell touched
him on the shoulder and said, &#8220;He is sleeping now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear my brother breathe,&#8221; answered Arrowhead.
&#8220;He will live.&#8221;</p>
<p>All night he had listened, and had heard Jim&#8217;s breath
as only a man who has lived in waste places can hear.
&#8220;He will live. What I take with one hand I give with
the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had taken the life of the factor; he had given Jim
his life. And when he was tried three months later for
murder, some one else said this for him, and the hearts
of all, judge and jury, were so moved they knew not
what to do.</p>
<p>But Arrowhead was never sentenced, for, at the end
of the first day&#8217;s trial, he lay down to sleep and never
waked again. He was found the next morning still and
cold, and there was clasped in his hands a little doll
which Nancy had given him on one of her many visits
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
to the prison during her father&#8217;s long illness. They
found a piece of paper in his belt with these words in
the Cree language: &#8220;With my hands on his heart at
the post I gave him the life that was in me, saving but
a little until now. Arrowhead, the chief, goes to find
life again by the well at the root of the tree. <i>How!</i>&#8221;</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>V</p>
</div>

<p>On the evening of the day that Arrowhead made his
journey to &#8220;the well at the root of the tree&#8221; a stranger
knocked at the door of Captain Templeton&#8217;s cottage;
then, without awaiting admittance, entered.</p>
<p>Jim was sitting with Nancy on his knee, her head
against his shoulder, Sally at his side, her face alight
with some inner joy. Before the knock came to the door
Jim had just said, &#8220;Why do your eyes shine so, Sally?
What&#8217;s in your mind?&#8221; She had been about to answer,
to say to him what had been swelling her heart with
pride, though she had not meant to tell him what he
had forgotten&mdash;not till midnight. But the figure that
entered the room, a big man with deep-set eyes, a man
of power who had carried everything before him in the
battle of life, answered for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have won the stake, Jim,&#8221; he said, in a hoarse
voice. &#8220;You and she have won the stake, and I&#8217;ve
brought it&mdash;brought it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before they could speak he placed in Sally&#8217;s hands
bonds for five million dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim&mdash;Jim, my son!&#8221; he burst out. Then, suddenly,
he sank into a chair and, putting his head in his hands,
sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, but I&#8217;m proud of you&mdash;speak to me, Jim.
You&#8217;ve broken me up.&#8221; He was ashamed of his tears,
but he could not wipe them away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Father, dear old man!&#8221; said Jim, and put his hands
on the broad shoulders.</p>
<p>Sally knelt down beside him, took both the great
hands from the tear-stained face, and laid them against
her cheek. But presently she put Nancy on his knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like you to cry,&#8221; the child said, softly; &#8220;but
to-day I cried too, &#8217;cause my Indian man is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man could not speak, but he put his cheek
down to hers. After a minute, &#8220;Oh, but she&#8217;s worth
ten times that!&#8221; he said, as Sally came close to him
with the bundle he had thrust into her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s five million dollars&mdash;for Nancy,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five&mdash;million&mdash;what&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stake, Jim,&#8221; said Sally. &#8220;If you did not drink
for four years&mdash;never touched a drop&mdash;we were to have
five million dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never told him, then&mdash;you never told him
that?&#8221; asked the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted him to win without it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If
he won, he would be the stronger; if he lost, it would
not be so hard for him to bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man drew her down and kissed her cheek.
He chuckled, though the tears were still in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a wonder&mdash;the tenth wonder of the world!&#8221;
he blurted.</p>
<p>Jim stood staring at the bundle in Nancy&#8217;s hands.
&#8220;Five millions&mdash;five million dollars!&#8221; he kept saying to
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said Nancy&#8217;s worth ten times that, Jim.&#8221; The old
man caught his hand and pressed it. &#8220;But it was a
damned near thing, I tell you,&#8221; he added. &#8220;They tried
to break me and my railways and my bank. I had to
fight the combination, and there was one day when I
hadn&#8217;t that five million dollars there, nor five. Jim,
they tried to break the old man! And if they&#8217;d broken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
me, they&#8217;d have made me out a scoundrel to her&mdash;to
this wife of yours who risked everything for both of us&mdash;for
both of us, Jim; for she&#8217;d given up the world to save
you, and she was playing like a soul in hell for heaven.
If they&#8217;d broken me, I&#8217;d never have lifted my head
again. When things were at their worst I played to
save that five millions&mdash;her stake and mine; I played
for that. I fought for it as a man fights his way out
of a burning house. And I won&mdash;I won. And it was
by fighting for that five millions I saved fifty&mdash;fifty
millions, son. They didn&#8217;t break the old man, Jim.
They didn&#8217;t break him&mdash;not much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are giants in the world still,&#8221; said Jim, his
own eyes full. He knew now his father and himself,
and he knew the meaning of all the bitter and misspent
life of the old days. He and his father were
on a level of understanding at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a giant?&#8221; asked Nancy, peering up into her
grandfather&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>The old man laughed, then sighed. &#8220;Perhaps I was
once, more or less, my dear,&#8221; saying to her what he
meant for the other two&mdash;&#8220;perhaps I was; but I&#8217;ve
finished. I&#8217;m through. I&#8217;ve had my last fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at his son. &#8220;I pass the game on to you,
Jim. You can do it. I knew you could do it as the
reports came in this year. I&#8217;ve had a detective up here
for four years. I had to do it. It was the devil in
me. You&#8217;ve got to carry on the game, Jim; I&#8217;m done.
I&#8217;ll stay home and potter about. I want to go back to
Kentucky, and build up the old place, and take care of
it a bit&mdash;your mother always loved it. I&#8217;d like to have
it as it was when she was there long ago. But I&#8217;ll be
ready to help you when I&#8217;m wanted, understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want me to run things&mdash;your colossal schemes?
You think&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think. I&#8217;m old enough to know,&#8221;</p>

<h2>WHEN THE SWALLOWS HOMEWARD FLY</h2>
</div>

<p>The arrogant Sun had stalked away into the evening,
trailing behind him banners of gold and crimson,
and a swift twilight was streaming over the land.
As the sun passed, the eyes of two men on a high hill
followed it, and the look of one was like a light in a
window to a lost traveller. It had in it the sense of
home and the tale of a journey done. Such a journey
this man had made as few have ever attempted and
fewer accomplished. To the farthermost regions of
snow and ice, where the shoulder of a continent juts
out into the northwestern arctic seas, he had travelled
on foot and alone, save for his dogs, and for Indian
guides who now and then shepherded him from point
to point. The vast ice-hummocks had been his housing;
pemmican, the raw flesh of fish, and even the fat and
oil of seals had been his food. Ever and ever through
long months the everlasting white glitter of the snow
and ice, ever and ever the cold stars, the cloudless sky,
the moon at full, or swung like a white sickle in the sky
to warn him that his life must be mown like grass. At
night to sleep in a bag of fur and wool, by day the
steely wind, or the air shaking with a filmy powder of
frost; while the illimitably distant sun made the tiny
flakes sparkle like silver&mdash;a <i>poudre</i> day, when the face
and hands are most like to be frozen, and all so still and
white and passionless, yet aching with energy. Hundreds
upon hundreds of miles that endless trail went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
winding to the farthest Northwest. No human being
had ever trod its lengths before, though Indians or a
stray Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company man had made journeys
over part of it during the years that have passed since
Prince Rupert sent his adventurers to dot that northern
land with posts and forts and trace fine arteries of civilization
through the wastes.</p>
<p>Where this man had gone none other had been of white
men from the western lands, though from across the
wide Pacific, from the Eastern world, adventurers and
exiles had once visited what is now known as the Yukon
Valley. So this man, browsing in the library of his
grandfather, an Eastern scholar, had come to know;
and for love of adventure, and because of the tale of a
valley of gold and treasure to be had, and because he
had been ruined by bad investments, he had made a
journey like none ever essayed before. And on his
way up to those regions, where the veil before the face
of God is very thin and fine, and men&#8217;s hearts glow
within them, where there was no oasis save the unguessed
deposit of a great human dream that his soul
could feel, the face of a girl had haunted him. Her
voice&mdash;so sweet a voice that it rang like muffled silver
in his ears, till, in the everlasting theatre of the pole,
the stars seemed to repeat it through millions of echoing
hills, growing softer and softer as the frost hushed it
to his ears&mdash;had said to him late and early, &#8220;You must
come back with the swallows.&#8221; Then she had sung a
song which had been like a fire in his heart, not alone
because of the words of it, but because of the soul in her
voice, and it had lain like a coverlet on his heart to
keep it warm:</p>

<p>It had been but an acquaintance of five days while
he fitted out for his expedition, but in this brief time
it had sunk deep into his mind that life was now a thing
to cherish, and that he must indeed come back; though
he had left England caring little if, in the peril and
danger of his quest, he ever returned. He had been
indifferent to his fate till he came to the Valley of the
Saskatchewan, to the town lying at the foot of the
maple hill beside the great northern stream, and saw
the girl whose life was knit with the far North, whose
mother&#8217;s heart was buried in the great wastes where
Sir John Franklin&#8217;s expedition was lost; for her husband
had been one of the ill-fated if not unhappy band
of lovers of that civilization for which they had risked
all and lost all save immortality. Hither the two had
come after he had been cast away on the icy plains, and,
as the settlement had crept north, had gone north with
it, always on the outer edge of house and field, ever
stepping northward. Here, with small income but
high hearts and quiet souls, they had lived and labored.</p>
<p>And when this newcomer from the old land set his
face northward to an unknown destination, the two
women had prayed as the mother did in the old days
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
when the daughter was but a babe at her knee, and it
was not yet certain that Franklin and his men had been
cast away forever. Something in him&mdash;his great height,
his strength of body, his clear, meditative eyes, his brave
laugh&mdash;reminded her of him, her husband, who, like
Sir Humphrey Gilbert, had said that it mattered little
where men did their duty, since God was always near
to take or leave as it was His will. When Bickersteth
went, it was as though one they had known all their
lives had passed; and the woman knew also that a new
thought had been sown in her daughter&#8217;s mind, a new
door opened in her heart.</p>
<p>And he had returned. He was now looking down
into the valley where the village lay. Far, far over,
two days&#8217; march away, he could see the cluster of
houses, and the glow of the sun on the tin spire of
the little mission church where he had heard the girl
and her mother sing, till the hearts of all were swept
by feeling and ravished by the desire for &#8220;the peace
of the Holy Grail.&#8221; The village was, in truth, but a
day&#8217;s march away from him, but he was not alone,
and the journey could not be hastened. Beside him,
his eyes also upon the sunset and the village, was a
man in a costume half-trapper, half-Indian, with bushy
gray beard and massive frame, and a distant, sorrowful
look, like that of one whose soul was tuned to past
suffering. As he sat, his head sunk on his breast, his
elbow resting on a stump of pine&mdash;the token of a progressive
civilization&mdash;his chin upon his hand, he looked
like the figure of Moses made immortal by Michael
Angelo. But his strength was not like that of the man
beside him, who was thirty years younger. When he
walked, it was as one who had no destination, who had
no haven toward which to travel, who journeyed as one
to whom the world is a wilderness, and one tent or one
hut is the same as another, and none is home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>Like two ships meeting hull to hull on the wide seas,
where a few miles of water will hide them from each
other, whose ports are thousands of miles apart, whose
courses are not the same, they two had met, the elder
man, sick and worn and near to death, in the poor
hospitality of an Indian&#8217;s tepee. John Bickersteth had
nursed the old man back to strength, and had brought
him southward with him&mdash;a silent companion, who
spoke in monosyllables, who had no conversation at all
of the past and little of the present, but who was a
woodsman and an arctic traveller of the most expert
kind, who knew by instinct where the best places for
shelter and for sleeping might be found, who never complained,
and was wonderful with the dogs. Close as
their association was, Bickersteth had felt concerning
the other that his real self was in some other sphere or
place toward which his mind was always turning, as
though to bring it back.</p>
<p>Again and again had Bickersteth tried to get the
old man to speak about the past, but he had been met
by a dumb sort of look, a straining to understand.
Once or twice the old man had taken his hands in both
of his own and gazed with painful eagerness into his
face, as though trying to remember or to comprehend
something that eluded him. Upon these occasions the
old man&#8217;s eyes dropped tears in an apathetic quiet,
which tortured Bickersteth beyond bearing. Just such
a look he had seen in the eyes of a favorite dog when he
had performed an operation on it to save its life&mdash;a
reproachful, non-comprehending, loving gaze.</p>
<p>Bickersteth understood a little of the Chinook language,
which is familiar to most Indian tribes, and he
had learned that the Indians knew nothing exact concerning
the old man; but rumors had passed from tribe
to tribe that this white man had lived forever in the
farthest North among the arctic tribes, and that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
passed from people to people, disappearing into the
untenanted wilderness, but reappearing again among
stranger tribes, never resting, and as one always seeking
what he could not find.</p>
<p>One thing had helped this old man in all his travels
and sojourning. He had, as it seemed to the native
people, a gift of the hands; for when they were sick
a few moments&#8217; manipulation of his huge, quiet fingers
vanquished pain. A few herbs he gave in tincture, and
these also were praised; but it was a legend that when
he was persuaded to lay on his hands and close his
eyes, and with his fingers to &#8220;search for the pain and
find it, and kill it,&#8221; he always prevailed. They believed
that, though his body was on earth, his soul was with
Manitou, and that it was his soul which came into him
again, and gave the Great Spirit&#8217;s healing to the fingers.
This had been the man&#8217;s safety through how many
years&mdash;or how many generations&mdash;they did not know;
for legends regarding the pilgrim had grown and were
fostered by the medicine-men, who, by giving him great
age and supernatural power, could, with more self-respect,
apologize for their own incapacity.</p>
<p>So the years&mdash;how many it was impossible to tell,
since he did not know or would not say&mdash;had gone
on; and now, after ceaseless wandering, his face was
turned toward that civilization out of which he had
come so long ago&mdash;or was it so long ago?&mdash;one generation,
or two, or ten? It seemed to Bickersteth at times
as though it were ten, so strange, so unworldly was his
companion. At first he thought that the man remembered
more than he would appear to acknowledge, but
he found that after a day or two everything that happened
as they journeyed was also forgotten.</p>
<p>It was only visible things, or sounds, that appeared
to open the doors of memory of the most recent happenings.
These happenings, if not varied, were of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
critical moment, since, passing down from the land of
unchanging ice and snow, they had come into March
and April storms and the perils of the rapids and the
swollen floods of May. Now, in June, two years and a
month since Bickersteth had gone into the wilds, they
looked down upon the goal of one at least&mdash;of the younger
man who had triumphed in his quest up in these wilds
abandoned centuries ago.</p>
<p>With the joyous thought in his heart that he had discovered
anew one of the greatest gold-fields of the world,
that a journey unparalleled had been accomplished, he
turned toward his ancient companion, and a feeling of
pity and human love enlarged within him. He, John
Bickersteth, was going into a world again where&mdash;as he
believed&mdash;a happy fate awaited him; but what of this
old man? He had brought him out of the wilds, out
of the unknown&mdash;was he only taking him into the unknown
again? Were there friends, any friends anywhere
in the world, waiting for him? He called himself by no
name, he said he had no name. Whence came he? Of
whom? Whither was he wending now? Bickersteth had
thought of the problem often, and he had no answer for
it save that he must be taken care of, if not by others,
then by himself; for the old man had saved him from
drowning; had also saved him from an awful death on
a March day when he fell into a great hole and was
knocked insensible in the drifting snow; had saved him
from brooding on himself&mdash;the beginning of madness&mdash;by
compelling him to think for another. And sometimes,
as he looked at the old man, his imagination
had caught the spirit of the legend of the Indians, and
he had cried out, &#8220;O soul, come back and give him
memory&mdash;give him back his memory, Manitou the
mighty!&#8221;</p>

THE OLD MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD. THOUGH NOT WITH UNDERSTANDING<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>Looking on the old man now, an impulse seized him.
&#8220;Dear old man,&#8221; he said, speaking as one speaks to a
child that cannot understand, &#8220;you shall never want
while I have a penny, or have head or hands to work.
But is there no one that you care for or that cares for
you, that you remember, or that remembers you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head, though not with understanding,
and he laid a hand on the young man&#8217;s shoulder,
and whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Once it was always snow, but now it is green, the
land. I have seen it&mdash;I have seen it once.&#8221; His shaggy
eyebrows gathered over, his eyes searched, searched the
face of John Bickersteth. &#8220;Once, so long ago&mdash;I cannot
think,&#8221; he added, helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear old man,&#8221; Bickersteth said, gently, knowing
he would not wholly comprehend, &#8220;I am going to ask her&mdash;Alice&mdash;to
marry me, and if she does, she will help
look after you, too. Neither of us would have been
here without the other, dear old man, and we shall not
be separated. Whoever you are, you are a gentleman,
and you might have been my father or hers&mdash;or hers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly. A thought had flashed through
his mind, a thought which stunned him, which passed
like some powerful current through his veins, shocked
him, then gave him a palpitating life. It was a wild
thought, but yet why not?&mdash;why not? There was the
chance, the faint, far-off chance. He caught the old
man by the shoulders and looked him in the eyes,
scanned his features, pushed back the hair from the
rugged forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear old man,&#8221; he said, his voice shaking, &#8220;do you
know what I&#8217;m thinking? I&#8217;m thinking that you may
be of those who went out to the Arctic Sea with Sir John
Franklin&mdash;with Sir John Franklin, you understand.
Did you know Sir John Franklin?&mdash;is it true, dear old
boy?&mdash;is it true? Are you one that has lived to tell the
tale? Did you know Sir John Franklin?&mdash;is it&mdash;tell me,
is it true?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>He let go the old man&#8217;s shoulders, for over the face
of the other there had passed a change. It was strained
and tense. The hands were outstretched, the eyes were
staring straight into the west and the coming night.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is&mdash;it is&mdash;that&#8217;s it!&#8221; cried Bickersteth. &#8220;That&#8217;s
it&mdash;oh, love o&#8217; God, that&#8217;s it! Sir John Franklin&mdash;Sir
John Franklin, and all the brave lads that died up there!
You remember the ship&mdash;the Arctic Sea&mdash;the ice-fields,
and Franklin&mdash;you remember him? Dear old man, say
you remember Franklin?&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing had seized him. Conviction was upon him,
and he watched the other&#8217;s anguished face with anguish
and excitement in his own. But&mdash;but it might be, it
might be her father&mdash;the eyes, the forehead are like
hers; the hands, the long hands, the pointed fingers.
&#8220;Dear old man, did you have a wife and child, and
were they both called Alice&mdash;do you remember? Franklin!&mdash;Alice!
Do you remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man got slowly to his feet, his arms outstretched,
the look in his face changing, understanding,
struggling for its place, memory fighting for its own,
the soul contending for its mastery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Franklin&mdash;Alice&mdash;the snow,&#8221; he said, confusedly,
and sank down.</p>
<p>&#8220;God have mercy!&#8221; cried Bickersteth, as he caught
the swaying body and laid it upon the ground. &#8220;He
was there&mdash;almost.&#8221;</p>
<p>He settled the old man against the great pine stump
and chafed his hands. &#8220;Man, dear man, if you belong
to her&mdash;if you do, can&#8217;t you see what it will mean to
me? She can&#8217;t say no to me then. But if it&#8217;s true,
you&#8217;ll belong to England and to all the world, too, and
you&#8217;ll have fame everlasting. I&#8217;ll have gold for her and
for you, and for your Alice, too, dear old man. Wake
up now and remember if you are Dyke Allingham, who
went with Franklin to the silent seas of the Pole. If it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
you, really you, what wonder you lost your memory!
You saw them all die, Franklin and all, die there in the
snow, with all the white world round them. If you were
there, what a travel you have had, what strange things
you have seen! Where the world is loneliest, God lives
most. If you get close to the heart of things, it&#8217;s no
marvel you forgot what you were, or where you came
from; because it didn&#8217;t matter; you knew that you were
only one of thousands of millions who have come and
gone, that make up the soul of things, that make the
pulses of the universe beat. That&#8217;s it, dear old man.
The universe would die, if it weren&#8217;t for the souls that
leave this world and fill it with life. Wake up! Wake
up, Allingham, and tell us where you&#8217;ve been, and what
you&#8217;ve seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not labor in vain. Slowly consciousness came
back, and the gray eyes opened wide, the lips smiled
faintly under the bushy beard; but Bickersteth saw that
the look in the face was much the same as it had been
before. The struggle had been too great, the fight for
the other lost self had exhausted him, mind and body,
and only a deep obliquity and a great weariness filled
the countenance. He had come back to the verge, he
had almost again discovered himself; but the opening
door had shut fast suddenly, and he was back again in
the night, the incompanionable night of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Bickersteth saw that the travail and strife had drained
life and energy, and that he must not press the mind
and vitality of this exile of time and the unknown too
far. He felt that when the next test came the old man
would either break completely, and sink down into another
and everlasting forgetfulness, or tear away forever
the veil between himself and his past, and emerge into
a long-lost life. His strength must be shepherded, and
he must be kept quiet and undisturbed until they came
to the town yonder in the valley, over which the night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
was slowly settling down. There two women waited,
the two Alices, from both of whom had gone lovers into
the North. The daughter was living over again in her
young love the pangs of suspense through which her
mother had passed. Two years since Bickersteth had
gone, and not a sign!</p>
<p>Yet, if the girl had looked from her bedroom window,
this Friday night, she would have seen on the far hill a
sign; for there burned a fire beside which sat two travellers
who had come from the uttermost limits of snow.
But as the fire burned&mdash;a beacon to her heart if she had
but known it&mdash;she went to her bed, the words of a song
she had sung at choir-practice with tears in her voice
and in her heart ringing in her ears. A concert was to be
held after the service on the coming Sunday night, at
which there was to be a collection for funds to build
another mission-house a hundred miles farther north,
and she had been practising music she was to sing. Her
mother had been an amateur singer of great power, and
she was renewing her mother&#8217;s gift in a voice behind
which lay a hidden sorrow. As she cried herself to sleep
the words of the song which had moved her kept ringing
in her ears and echoing in her heart:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;When the swallows homeward fly,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And the roses&#8217; bloom is o&#8217;er&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>But her mother, looking out into the night, saw on
the far hill the fire, burning like a star, where she had
never seen a fire set before, and a hope shot into her
heart for her daughter&mdash;a hope that had flamed up and
died down so often during the past year. Yet she had
fanned with heartening words every such glimmer of
hope when it came, and now she went to bed saying,
&#8220;Perhaps he will come to-morrow.&#8221; In her mind, too,
rang the words of the song which had ravished her ears
that night, the song she had sung the night before her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
own husband, Dyke Allingham, had gone with Franklin
to the Polar seas:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;When the swallows homeward fly&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>As she and her daughter entered the little church on
the Sunday evening, two men came over the prairie
slowly toward the town, and both raised their heads to
the sound of the church-bell calling to prayer. In the
eyes of the younger man there was a look which has
come to many in this world returning from hard enterprise
and great dangers, to the familiar streets, the
friendly faces of men of their kin and clan&mdash;to the lights
of home.</p>
<p>The face of the older man, however, had another look.
It was such a look as is seldom seen in the faces of men,
for it showed the struggle of a soul to regain its identity.
The words which the old man had uttered in response
to Bickersteth&#8217;s appeal before he fainted away&mdash;&#8220;Franklin&mdash;Alice&mdash;the
snow&#8221;&mdash;had showed that he was on the
verge; the bells of the church pealing in the summer
air brought him near it once again. How many years
had gone since he had heard church-bells? Bickersteth,
gazing at him in eager scrutiny, wondered if, after all,
he might be mistaken about him. But no, this man
had never been born and bred in the Far North. His was
a type which belonged to the civilization from which he
himself had come. There would soon be the test of it
all. Yet he shuddered, too, to think what might happen
if it was all true, and discovery or reunion should
shake to the centre the very life of the two long-parted
ones.</p>
<p>He saw the look of perplexed pain and joy at once in
the face of the old man, but he said nothing, and he was
almost glad when the bell stopped. The old man turned
to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I remember&mdash;&#8221; but he
stopped suddenly, shaking his head.</p>
<p>An hour later, cleared of the dust of travel, the two
walked slowly toward the church from the little tavern
where they were lodged. The service was now over,
but the concert had begun. The church was full, and
there were people in the porch; but these made way for
the two strangers; and, as Bickersteth was recognized
by two or three present, place was found for them.
Inside, the old man stared round him in a confused and
troubled way, but his motions were quiet and abstracted,
and he looked like some old viking, his workaday life
done, come to pray ere he went hence forever. They
had entered in a pause in the concert, but now two
ladies came forward to the chancel steps, and one with
her hands clasped before her, began to sing:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;When the swallows homeward fly,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And the roses&#8217; bloom is o&#8217;er,</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>In the woods is heard no more&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>It was Alice&mdash;Alice the daughter&mdash;and presently the
mother, the other Alice, joined in the refrain. At sight
of them Bickersteth&#8217;s eyes had filled, not with tears, but
with a cloud of feeling, so that he went blind. There
she was, the girl he loved. Her voice was ringing in his
ears. In his own joy for one instant he had forgotten
the old man beside him and the great test that was now
upon him. He turned quickly, however, as the old man
got to his feet. For an instant the lost exile of the
North stood as though transfixed. The blood slowly
drained from his face, and in his eyes was an agony of
struggle and desire. For a moment an awful confusion
had the mastery, and then suddenly a clear light broke
into his eyes, his face flushed healthily and shone, his
arms went up, and there rang in his ears the words:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Then I think, with bitter pain,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Alice!&mdash;Alice!&#8221; he called, and tottered forward up
the aisle, followed by John Bickersteth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice, I have come back!&#8221; he cried again.</p>

<h2>GEORGE&#8217;S WIFE</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s come, and she can go back. No one asked
her, no one wants her, and she&#8217;s got no rights here.
She thinks she&#8217;ll come it over me, but she&#8217;ll get nothing,
and there&#8217;s no place for her here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old, gray-bearded man, gnarled and angular, with
overhanging brows and a harsh face, made this little
speech of malice and unfriendliness, looking out on the
snow-covered prairie through the window. Far in the
distance were a sleigh and horses like a spot in the
snow, growing larger from minute to minute.</p>
<p>It was a day of days. Overhead the sun was pouring
out a flood of light and warmth, and, though it was bitterly
cold, life was beating hard in the bosom of the West.
Men walked lightly, breathed quickly, and their eyes
were bright with the brightness of vitality and content.
Even the old man at the window of this lonely house,
in a great, lonely stretch of country, with the cedar hills
behind it, had a living force which defied his seventy-odd
years, though the light in his face was hard and his
voice was harder still. Under the shelter of the foothills,
cold as the day was, his cattle were feeding in the open,
scratching away the thin layer of snow and browsing
on the tender grass underneath. An arctic world in
appearance, it had an abounding life which made it
friendly and generous&mdash;the harshness belonged to the
surface. So, perhaps, it was with the old man who
watched the sleigh in the distance coming nearer, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
that in his nature on which any one could feed was not
so easily reached as the fresh young grass under the
protecting snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get nothing out of me,&#8221; he repeated, as the
others in the room behind him made no remark, and his
eyes ranged gloatingly over the cattle under the foothills
and the buildings which he had gathered together
to proclaim his substantial greatness in the West. &#8220;Not
a <i>sou markee</i>!&#8221; he added, clinking some coins in his
pocket. &#8220;She&#8217;s got no rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cassy&#8217;s got as much right here as any of us, Abel,
and she&#8217;s coming to say it, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice which spoke was unlike a Western voice.
It was deep and full and slow, with an organ-like quality.
It was in good-keeping with the tall, spare body and
large, fine, rugged face of the woman to whom it belonged.
She sat in a rocking-chair, but did not rock,
her fingers busy with the knitting-needles, her feet
planted squarely on the home-made hassock at her feet.</p>
<p>The old man waited for a minute in a painful silence,
then he turned slowly round, and, with tight-pressed
lips, looked at the woman in the rocking-chair. If it
had been any one else who had &#8220;talked back&#8221; at him,
he would have made quick work of them, for he was
of that class of tyrant who pride themselves on being
self-made, and have an undue respect for their own
judgment and importance. But the woman who had
ventured to challenge his cold-blooded remarks about
his dead son&#8217;s wife, now hastening over the snow to the
house her husband had left under a cloud eight years
before, had no fear of him, and, maybe, no deep regard
for him. He respected her, as did all who knew her&mdash;a
very reticent, thoughtful, busy being, who had been
like a well of comfort to so many that had drunk and
passed on out of her life, out of time and time&#8217;s experiences.
Seventy-nine years saw her still upstanding,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
strong, full of work, and fuller of life&#8217;s knowledge. It
was she who had sent the horses and sleigh for Cassy
when the old man, having read the letter that Cassy
had written him, said that she could &#8220;freeze at the
station&#8221; for all of him. Aunt Kate had said nothing
then, but, when the time came, by her orders the sleigh
and horses were at the station; and the old man had
made no direct protest, for she was the one person he
had never dominated nor bullied. If she had only
talked, he would have worn her down, for he was fond
of talking, and it was said by those who were cynical
and incredulous about him that he had gone to prayer-meetings,
had been a local preacher, only to hear his
own voice. Probably, if there had been any politics in
the West in his day, he would have been a politician,
though it would have been too costly for his taste, and
religion was very cheap; it enabled him to refuse to
join in many forms of expenditure, on the ground that
he &#8220;did not hold by such things.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Aunt Kate, the sister of his wife, dead so many
years ago, he had found a spirit stronger than his own.
He valued her; he had said more than once, to those
who he thought would never repeat it to her, that she
was a &#8220;great woman&#8221;; but self-interest was the mainspring
of his appreciation. Since she had come again to
his house&mdash;she had lived with him once before for two
years when his wife was slowly dying&mdash;it had been a
different place. Housekeeping had cost less than before,
yet the cooking was better, the place was beautifully
clean, and discipline without rigidity reigned everywhere.
One by one the old woman&#8217;s boys and girls
had died&mdash;four of them&mdash;and she was now alone, with
not a single grandchild left to cheer her; and the life
out here with Abel Baragar had been unrelieved by much
that was heartening to a woman; for Black Andy, Abel&#8217;s
son, was not an inspiring figure, though even his moroseness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
gave way under her influence. So it was that when
Cassy&#8217;s letter came her breast seemed to grow warmer
and swell with longing to see the wife of her nephew,
who had such a bad reputation in Abel&#8217;s eyes, and to
see George&#8217;s little boy, who was coming, too. After all,
whatever Cassy was, she was the mother of Abel&#8217;s son&#8217;s
son; and Aunt Kate was too old and wise to be frightened
by tales told of Cassy or any one else. So, having had
her own way so far regarding Cassy&#8217;s coming, she looked
Abel calmly in the eyes, over the gold-rimmed spectacles
which were her dearest possession&mdash;almost the only
thing of value she had. She was not afraid of Abel&#8217;s
anger, and he knew it; but his eldest son, Black Andy,
was present, and he must make a show of being master
of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Kate,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t make a fuss about
you sending the horses and sleigh for her, because
women do fool things sometimes. I suppose curiosity
got the best of you. Anyhow, mebbe it&#8217;s right Cassy
should find out, once for all, how things stand, and that
they haven&#8217;t altered since she took George away, and
ruined his life, and sent him to his grave. That&#8217;s why
I didn&#8217;t order Mick back when I saw him going out with
the team.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cassy Mavor,&#8221; interjected a third voice from a
corner behind the great stove&mdash;&#8220;Cassy Mavor, of the
variety-dance-and-song, and a talk with the gallery
between!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Kate looked over at Black Andy, and stopped
knitting, for there was that in the tone of the sullen
ranchman which stirred in her a sudden anger, and
anger was a rare and uncomfortable sensation to her.
A flush crept slowly over her face, then it died away,
and she said quietly to Black Andy&mdash;for she had ever
prayed to be master of the demon of temper down deep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
in her, and she was praying now&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;She earnt her living by singing and dancing, and
she&#8217;s brought up George&#8217;s boy by it, and singing and
dancing isn&#8217;t a crime. David danced before the Lord.
I danced myself when I was a young girl, and before I
joined the church. &#8217;Twas about the only pleasure I
ever had; &#8217;bout the only one I like to remember. There&#8217;s
no difference to me &#8217;twixt making your feet handy and
clever and full of music, and playing with your fingers
on the piano or on a melodeon at a meeting. As for
singing, it&#8217;s God&#8217;s gift; and many a time I wisht I had
it. I&#8217;d have sung the blackness out of your face and
heart, Andy.&#8221; She leaned back again and began to knit
very fast. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to hear Cassy sing, and see her
dance, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Andy chuckled coarsely. &#8220;I often heard her
sing and saw her dance down at Lumley&#8217;s before she
took George away East. You wouldn&#8217;t have guessed
she had consumption. She knocked the boys over
down to Lumley&#8217;s. The first night at Lumley&#8217;s done
for George.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Andy&#8217;s face showed no lightening of its gloom
as he spoke, but there was a firing-up of the black eyes,
and the woman with the knitting felt that&mdash;for whatever
reason&mdash;he was purposely irritating his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil was in her heels and in her tongue,&#8221; Andy
continued. &#8220;With her big mouth, red hair, and little
eyes she&#8217;d have made anybody laugh. I laughed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You laughed!&#8221; snapped out his father, with a sneer.</p>
<p>Black Andy&#8217;s eyes half closed with a morose look, then
he went on: &#8220;Yes, I laughed at Cassy. While she was
out here at Lumley&#8217;s getting cured, accordin&#8217; to the
doctor&#8217;s orders, things seemed to get a move on in the
West. But it didn&#8217;t suit professing Christians like you,
dad.&#8221; He jerked his head toward the old man and drew
the spittoon near with his feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The West hasn&#8217;t been any worse off since she left,&#8221;
snarled the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she took George with her,&#8221; grimly retorted
Black Andy.</p>
<p>Abel Baragar&#8217;s heart had been warmer toward his
dead son George than to any one else in the world.
George had been as fair of face and hair as Andrew was
dark, as cheerful and amusing as Andrew was gloomy
and dispiriting, as agile and dexterous of mind and body
as his brother was slow and angular, as emotional and
warm-hearted as the other was phlegmatic and sour&mdash;or
so it seemed to the father and to nearly all others.</p>
<p>In those old days they had not been very well off.
The railway was not completed, and the West had not
begun &#8220;to move.&#8221; The old man had bought and sold
land and cattle and horses, always living on a narrow
margin of safety, but in the hope that one day the choice
bits of land he was shepherding here and there would
take a leap up in value; and his judgment had been right.
His prosperity had all come since George went away
with Cassy Mavor. His anger at George had been the
more acute, because the thing happened at a time when
his affairs were on the edge of a precipice. He had won
through it, but only by the merest shave, and it had all
left him with a bad spot in his heart, in spite of his
&#8220;having religion.&#8221; Whenever he remembered George
he instinctively thought of those black days when a
Land and Cattle Syndicate was crowding him over the
edge into the chasm of failure, and came so near doing
it. A few thousand dollars less to put up here and
there, and he would have been ruined; his blood became
hotter whenever he thought of it. He had had to
fight the worst of it through alone, for George, who had
been useful as a kind of buyer and seller, who was ever
all things to all men, and ready with quip and jest, and
not a little uncertain as to truth&mdash;to which the old man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
shut his eyes when there was a &#8220;deal&#8221; on&mdash;had, in the
end, been of no use at all, and had seemed to go to
pieces just when he was most needed. His father had
put it all down to Cassy Mavor, who had unsettled things
since she had come to Lumley&#8217;s, and, being a man of very
few ideas, he cherished those he had with an exaggerated
care. Prosperity had not softened him; it had given
him an arrogance unduly emphasized by a reputation
for rigid virtue and honesty. The indirect attack which
Andrew now made on George&#8217;s memory roused him to
anger, as much because it seemed to challenge his own
judgment as cast a slight on the name of the boy whom
he had cast off, yet who had a firmer hold on his heart
than any human being ever had. It had only been pride
which had prevented him from making it up with George
before it was too late; but, all the more, he was set
against the woman who &#8220;kicked up her heels for a living&#8221;;
and, all the more, he resented Black Andy, who,
in his own grim way, had managed to remain a partner
with him in their present prosperity, and had done so
little for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;George helped to make what you&#8217;ve got,&#8221; he said,
darkly, now. &#8220;The West missed George. The West
said, &#8216;There was a good man ruined by a woman.&#8217; The
West&#8217;d never think anything or anybody missed you,
&#8217;cept yourself. When you went North, it never missed
you; when you come back, its jaw fell. You wasn&#8217;t fit
to black George&#8217;s boots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Andy&#8217;s mouth took on a bitter sort of smile,
and his eyes drooped furtively as he struck the damper
of the stove heavily with his foot; then he replied,
slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all right; but if I wasn&#8217;t fit to black his
boots, it ain&#8217;t my fault. I git my nature honest, as he
did. We wasn&#8217;t any cross-breeds, I s&#8217;pose. We got
the strain direct, and we was all right on her side.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>He jerked his head toward Aunt Kate, whose face was
growing pale. She interposed now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you leave the dead alone?&#8221; she asked, in a
voice ringing a little. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you let them rest? Ain&#8217;t
it enough to quarrel about the living? Cassy&#8217;ll be
here soon,&#8221; she added, peering out of the window, &#8220;and
if I was you I&#8217;d try and not make her sorry she ever
married a Baragar. It ain&#8217;t a feeling that&#8217;d make a
sick woman live long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Kate did not strike often, but when she did she
struck hard. Abel Baragar staggered a little under this
blow, for, at the moment, it seemed to him that he saw
his dead wife&#8217;s face looking at him from the chair where
her sister now sat. Down in his ill-furnished heart,
where there had been little which was companionable,
there was a shadowed corner. Sophy Baragar had
been such a true-hearted, brave-souled woman, and he
had been so impatient and exacting with her, till the
beautiful face, which had been reproduced in George,
had lost its color and its fire, had become careworn and
sweet with that sweetness which goes early out of the
world. In all her days the vanished wife had never
hinted at as much as Aunt Kate suggested now, and
Abel Baragar shut his eyes against the thing which he
was seeing. He was not all hard, after all.</p>
<p>Aunt Kate turned to Black Andy now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe Cassy ain&#8217;t for long,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mebbe
she&#8217;s come out for what she came out for before. It
seems to me it&#8217;s that, or she wouldn&#8217;t have come; because
she&#8217;s young yet, and she&#8217;s fond of her boy, and
she&#8217;d not want to bury herself alive out here with us.
Mebbe her lungs is bad again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she&#8217;s sure to get another husband out here,&#8221;
said the old man, recovering himself. &#8220;She got one
before easy, on the same ticket.&#8221; With something of
malice he looked over at Black Andy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If she can sing and dance as she done nine years
ago, I shouldn&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; answered Black Andy,
smoothly. These two men knew each other; they had
said hard things to each other for many a year, yet they
lived on together unshaken by each other&#8217;s moods and
bitternesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting old&mdash;I&#8217;m seventy-nine&mdash;and I ain&#8217;t
for long,&#8221; urged Aunt Kate, looking Abel in the eyes.
&#8220;Some day soon I&#8217;ll be stepping out and away. Then
things&#8217;ll go to sixes and sevens, as they did after Sophy
died. Some one ought to be here that&#8217;s got a right to
be here, not a hired woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the old man raged out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Her&mdash;off the stage to look after this! Her, that&#8217;s
kicked up her heels for a living! It&#8217;s&mdash;no, she&#8217;s no
good. She&#8217;s common. She&#8217;s come, and she can go.
I ain&#8217;t having sweepings from the streets living here as
if they had rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Kate set her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweepings! You&#8217;ve got to take that back, Abel.
It&#8217;s not Christian. You&#8217;ve got to take that back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll take it back all right before we&#8217;ve done, I
guess,&#8221; remarked Black Andy. &#8220;He&#8217;ll take a lot
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Truth&#8217;s truth, and I&#8217;ll stand by it, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man stopped, for there came to them now,
clearly, the sound of sleigh-bells. They all stood still
for an instant, silent and attentive, then Aunt Kate
moved toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cassy&#8217;s come,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Cassy and George&#8217;s boy&#8217;ve
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another instant and the door was opened on the
beautiful, white, sparkling world, and the low sleigh,
with its great, warm, buffalo robes, in which the small
figures of a woman and a child were almost lost, stopped
at the door. Two whimsical but tired eyes looked over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
a rim of fur at the old woman in the doorway, then
Cassy&#8217;s voice rang out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! that&#8217;s Aunt Kate, I know! Well, here we
are, and here&#8217;s my boy. Jump, George!&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later and the gaunt old woman folded both
mother and son in her arms and drew them into the
room. The door was shut, and they all faced one another.</p>
<p>The old man and Black Andy did not move, but
stood staring at the trim figure in black, with the plain
face, large mouth, and tousled red hair, and the dreamy-eyed,
handsome little boy beside her.</p>
<p>Black Andy stood behind the stove, looking over at
the new-comers with quizzical, almost furtive eyes, and
his father remained for a moment with mouth open,
gazing at his dead son&#8217;s wife and child, as though not
quite comprehending the scene. The sight of the
boy had brought back, in some strange, embarrassing
way, a vision of thirty years before, when George was
a little boy in buckskin pants and jacket, and was
beginning to ride the prairie with him. This boy was
like George, yet not like him. The face was George&#8217;s,
the sensuous, luxurious mouth; but the eyes were not
those of a Baragar, nor yet those of Aunt Kate&#8217;s family;
and they were not wholly like the mother&#8217;s. They
were full and brimming, while hers were small and
whimsical; yet they had her quick, humorous flashes
and her quaintness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I changed so much? Have you forgotten
me?&#8221; Cassy asked, looking the old man in the eyes.
&#8220;You look as strong as a bull.&#8221; She held out her hand
to him and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope I see you well,&#8221; said Abel Baragar, mechanically,
as he took the hand and shook it awkwardly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; answered the nonchalant little
woman, undoing her jacket. &#8220;Shake hands with your
grandfather, George. That&#8217;s right&mdash;don&#8217;t talk too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
much,&#8221; she added, with a half-nervous little laugh, as
the old man, with a kind of fixed smile, and the child
shook hands in silence.</p>
<p>Presently she saw Black Andy behind the stove.
&#8220;Well, Andy, have you been here ever since?&#8221; she
asked, and, as he came forward, she suddenly caught
him by both arms, stood on tiptoe, and kissed him.
&#8220;Last time I saw you, you were behind the stove at
Lumley&#8217;s. Nothing&#8217;s ever too warm for you,&#8221; she added.
&#8220;You&#8217;d be shivering on the equator. You were always
hugging the stove at Lumley&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Things were pretty warm there, too, Cassy,&#8221; he
said, with a sidelong look at his father.</p>
<p>She saw the look, her face flushed with sudden temper,
then her eyes fell on her boy, now lost in the arms of
Aunt Kate, and she curbed herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were plenty of things doing at Lumley&#8217;s in
those days,&#8221; she said, brusquely. &#8220;We were all young
and fresh then,&#8221; she added, and then something seemed
to catch her voice, and she coughed a little&mdash;a hard,
dry, feverish cough. &#8220;Are the Lumleys all right? Are
they still there, at the Forks?&#8221; she asked, after the little
paroxysm of coughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleaned out&mdash;all scattered. We own the Lumleys&#8217;
place now,&#8221; replied Black Andy, with another sidelong
glance at his father, who, as he put some more wood
on the fire and opened the damper of the stove wider,
grimly watched and listened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, and Lance, and Jerry, and Abner?&#8221; she asked,
almost abstractedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim&#8217;s dead&mdash;shot by a U. S. marshal by mistake
for a smuggler,&#8221; answered Black Andy, suggestively.
&#8220;Lance is up on the Yukon, busted; Jerry is one of
our hands on the place; and Abner is in jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abner&mdash;in jail!&#8221; she exclaimed, in a dazed way.
&#8220;What did he do? Abner always seemed so straight.&#8221;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he sloped with a thousand dollars of the railway
people&#8217;s money. They caught him, and he got seven
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was married, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; she asked, in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to Phenie Tyson. There&#8217;s no children, so she&#8217;s
all right, and divorce is cheap over in the States, where
she is now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phenie Tyson didn&#8217;t marry Abner because he was a
saint, but because he was a man, I suppose,&#8221; she replied,
gravely. &#8220;And the old folks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both dead. What Abner done sent the old man to
his grave. But Abner&#8217;s mother died a year before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What Abner done killed his father,&#8221; said Abel
Baragar, with dry emphasis. &#8220;Phenie Tyson was extravagant&mdash;wanted
this and that, and nothin&#8217; was too
good for her. Abner spoilt his life gettin&#8217; her what she
wanted; and it broke old Ezra Lumley&#8217;s heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>George&#8217;s wife looked at him for a moment with her
eyes screwed up, and then she laughed softly. &#8220;My,
it&#8217;s curious how some folks go up and some go down!
It must be lonely for Phenie waiting all these years for
Abner to get free.... I had the happiest time in my life
at Lumley&#8217;s. I was getting better of my&mdash;cold. While
I was there I got lots of strength stored up, to last
me many a year when I needed it; and, then, George
and I were married at Lumley&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Kate came slowly over with the boy and laid
a hand on Cassy&#8217;s shoulder, for there was an undercurrent
to the conversation which boded no good.
The very first words uttered had plunged Abel Baragar
and his son&#8217;s wife into the midst of the difficulty which
she had hoped might, after all, be avoided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, and I&#8217;ll show you your room, Cassy,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;It faces south, and you&#8217;ll get the sun all day.
It&#8217;s like a sun-parlor. We&#8217;re going to have supper in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
a couple of hours, and you must rest some first. Is
the house warm enough for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The little, garish woman did not reply directly, but
shook back her red hair and caught her boy to her
breast and kissed him; then she said, in that staccato
manner which had given her words on the stage such
point and emphasis: &#8220;Oh, this house is a&#8217;most too warm
for me, Aunt Kate!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she moved toward the door with the grave,
kindly old woman, her son&#8217;s hand in her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see the Lumleys&#8217; place from your window,
Cassy,&#8221; said Black Andy, grimly. &#8220;We got a mortgage
on it, and foreclosed it, and it&#8217;s ours now; and Jerry
Lumley&#8217;s stock-riding for us. Anyhow, he&#8217;s better off
than Abner, or Abner&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cassy turned at the door and faced him. Instinctively
she caught at some latent conflict with old Abel
Baragar in what Black Andy had said, and her face
softened, for it suddenly flashed into her mind that he
was not against her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to be back West,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It meant a
lot to me when I was at Lumley&#8217;s.&#8221; She coughed a
little again, but turned to the door with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you come to stay here&mdash;out West?&#8221;
asked the old man, furtively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s plenty of time to think of that!&#8221; she
answered, brusquely, and she heard Black Andy laugh
derisively as the door closed behind her.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>In a blaze of joy the sun swept down behind the
southern hills, and the windows of Lumley&#8217;s house at
the Forks, catching the oblique rays, glittered and
shone like flaming silver. Nothing of life showed, save
the cattle here and there, creeping away to the shelter
of the foothills for the night. The white, placid snow
made a coverlet as wide as the vision of the eye, save
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
where spruce and cedar trees gave a touch of warmth
and refuge here and there. A wonderful, buoyant
peace seemed to rest upon the wide, silent expanse.
The birds of song were gone South over the hills, and
the living wild things of the prairies had stolen into
winter-quarters. Yet, as Cassy Mavor looked out upon
the exquisite beauty of the scene, upon the splendid
outspanning of the sun along the hills, the deep plangent
blue of the sky and the thrilling light, she saw a
world in agony and she heard the moans of the afflicted.
The sun shone bright on the windows of Lumley&#8217;s
house, but she could hear the crying of Abner&#8217;s wife,
and of old Ezra and Eliza Lumley, when their children
were stricken or shamed; when Abel Baragar drew
tighter and tighter the chains of the mortgage, which at
last made them tenants in the house once their own.
Only eight years ago, and all this had happened. And
what had not happened to her, too, in those eight
years!</p>
<p>With George&mdash;reckless, useless, loving, lying George&mdash;she
had left Lumley&#8217;s with her sickness cured, as it
seemed, after a long year in the West, and had begun
life again. What sort of life had it been? &#8220;Kicking
up her heels on the stage,&#8221; as Abel Baragar had said;
but, somehow, not as it was before she went West to
give her perforated lung to the healing air of the plains,
and to live out-doors with the men&mdash;a man&#8217;s life. Then
she had never put a curb on her tongue, or greatly on
her actions, except that, though a hundred men quarrelled
openly, or in their own minds, about her, no one
had ever had any <i>right</i> to quarrel about her. With a
tongue which made men gasp with laughter, with as
comic a gift as ever woman had, and as equally comic a
face, she had been a good-natured little tyrant in her
way. She had given a kiss here and there, and had taken
one, but always there had been before her mind the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
picture of a careworn woman who struggled to bring up
her three children honestly, and without the help of
charity, and, with a sigh of content and weariness, had
died as Cassy made her first hit on the stage and her
name became a household word. And Cassy, garish,
gay, freckled, witty, and whimsical, had never forgotten
those days when her mother prayed and worked her
heart out to do her duty by her children. Cassy Mavor
had made her following, had won her place, was the
idol of &#8220;the gallery&#8221;; and yet she was &#8220;of the people,&#8221;
as she had always been, until her first sickness came,
and she had gone out to Lumley&#8217;s, out along the foothills
of the Rockies.</p>
<p>What had made her fall in love with George Baragar?
She could not have told, if she had been asked. He
was wayward, given to drink at times, given also to
card-playing and racing; but he had a way with him
which few women could resist and that made men his
friends; and he had a sense of humor akin to her own.
In any case, one day she let him catch her up in his
arms, and there was the end of it. But no, not the end,
after all. It was only the beginning of real life for her.
All that had gone before seemed but playing on the
threshold, though it had meant hard, bitter hard, work,
and temptation, and patience, and endurance of many
kinds. And now George was gone forever. But
George&#8217;s little boy lay there on the bed in a soft sleep,
with all his life before him.</p>
<p>She turned from the warm window and the buoyant,
inspiring scene to the bed. Stooping over, she kissed
the sleeping boy with an abrupt eagerness, and made a
little awkward, hungry gesture of love over him, and
her face flushed hot with the passion of motherhood in
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I&#8217;ve got now,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;Nothing else
left&mdash;nothing else at all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>She heard the door open behind her, and she turned
round. Aunt Kate was entering with a bowl in her
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you moving about, and I&#8217;ve brought you
something hot to drink,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s real good of you, Aunt Kate,&#8221; was the cheerful
reply. &#8220;But it&#8217;s near supper-time, and I don&#8217;t
need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s boneset tea&mdash;for your cold,&#8221; answered Aunt
Kate, gently, and put it on the high dressing-table made
of a wooden box and covered with muslin. &#8220;For your
cold, Cassy,&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p>The little woman stood still a moment gazing at the
steaming bowl, lines growing suddenly around her
mouth, then she looked at Aunt Kate quizzically.
&#8220;Is my cold bad&mdash;so bad that I need boneset?&#8221; she
asked, in a queer, constrained voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s comforting, is boneset tea, even when there&#8217;s no
cold, &#8217;specially when the whiskey&#8217;s good, and the boneset
and camomile has steeped some days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been steeping them some days?&#8221; Cassy
asked, softly, eagerly.</p>
<p>Aunt Kate nodded, then tried to explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always good to be prepared, and I didn&#8217;t know
but what the cold you used to have might be come
back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m glad if it ain&#8217;t&mdash;if that
cough of yours is only one of the measly little hacks
people get in the East, where it&#8217;s so damp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cassy was at the window again, looking out at the
dying radiance of the sun. Her voice seemed hollow
and strange and rather rough, as she said, in reply:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a real cold, deep down, the same as I had nine
years ago, Aunt Kate; and it&#8217;s come to stay, I guess.
That&#8217;s why I came back West. But I couldn&#8217;t have
gone to Lumley&#8217;s again, even if they were at the Forks
now, for I&#8217;m too poor. I&#8217;m a back-number now. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
had to give up singing and dancing a year ago, after
George died. So I don&#8217;t earn my living any more, and
I had to come to George&#8217;s father, with George&#8217;s boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Kate had a shrewd mind, and was tactful,
too. She did not understand why Cassy, who had
earned so much money all these years, should be so
poor now, unless it was that she hadn&#8217;t saved&mdash;that she
and George hadn&#8217;t saved. But, looking at the face
before her, and the child on the bed, she was convinced
that the woman was a good woman; that, singer and
dancer as she was, there was no reason why any home
should be closed to her, or any heart should shut its
doors before her. She guessed a reason for this poverty
of Cassy Mavor, but it only made her lay a hand on the
little woman&#8217;s shoulders and look into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cassy,&#8221; she said, gently, &#8220;you was right to come here.
There&#8217;s trials before you, but for the boy&#8217;s sake you
must bear them. Sophy, George&#8217;s mother, had to bear
them, and Abel was fond of her, too, in his way. He&#8217;s
stored up a lot of things to say, and he&#8217;ll say them; but
you&#8217;ll keep the boy in your mind, and be patient, won&#8217;t
you, Cassy? You got rights here, and it&#8217;s comfortable,
and there&#8217;s plenty, and the air will cure your lung as it
did before. It did all right before, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221; She
handed the bowl of boneset tea. &#8220;Take it; it&#8217;ll do you
good, Cassy,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Cassy said nothing in reply. She looked at the bed
where her boy lay, she looked at the angular face of the
woman, with its brooding motherliness, at the soft, gray
hair, and, with a little gasp of feeling, she raised the
bowl to her lips and drank freely. Then, putting it
down, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t mean to have us, Aunt Kate, but I&#8217;ll try
and keep my temper down. Did he ever laugh in his
life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He laughs sometimes&mdash;kind o&#8217; laughs.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make him laugh real, if I can,&#8221; Cassy rejoined.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve made a lot of people laugh in my time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old woman leaned suddenly over, and drew the
red, ridiculous head to her shoulder with a gasp of
affection, and her eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cassy,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;Cassy, you make me cry!&#8221;
and then she turned and hurried from the room.</p>
<p>Three hours later the problem was solved in the big
sitting-room where Cassy had first been received with
her boy. Aunt Kate sat with her feet on a hassock,
rocking gently and watching and listening. Black
Andy was behind the great stove with his chair tilted
back, carving the bowl of a pipe; the old man sat rigid
by the table, looking straight before him and smacking
his lips now and then as he was wont to do at meeting;
while Cassy, with her chin in her hands and elbows on
her knees, gazed into the fire and waited for the storm to
break.</p>
<p>Her little flashes of humor at dinner had not brightened
things, and she had had an insane desire to turn cartwheels
round the room, so implacable and highly
strained was the attitude of the master of the house,
so unctuous was the grace and the thanksgiving before
and after the meal. Abel Baragar had stored up his anger
and his righteous antipathy for years, and this was
the first chance he had had of visiting his displeasure
on the woman who had &#8220;ruined&#8221; George, and who
had now come to get &#8220;rights,&#8221; which he was determined
she should not have. He had steeled himself against
seeing any good in her whatever. Self-will, self-pride,
and self-righteousness were big in him, and so the
supper had ended in silence, and with a little attack
of coughing on the part of Cassy, which made her angry
at herself. Then the boy had been put to bed, and
she had come back to await the expected outburst.
She could feel it in the air, and while her blood tingled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
in a desire to fight this tyrant to the bitter end, she
thought of her boy and his future, and she calmed the
tumult in her veins.</p>
<p>She did not have to wait very long. The querulous
voice of the old man broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;When be you goin&#8217; back East? What time did you
fix for goin&#8217;?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She raised her head and looked at him squarely.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t fix any time for going East again,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;I came out West this time to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you was on the stage,&#8221; was the rejoinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve left the stage. My voice went when I got
a bad cold again, and I couldn&#8217;t stand the draughts
of the theatre, and so I couldn&#8217;t dance, either. I&#8217;m
finished with the stage. I&#8217;ve come out here for good
and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you think of livin&#8217; out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have gone to Lumley&#8217;s, but that&#8217;s not
possible, is it? Anyway, I couldn&#8217;t afford it now.
So I thought I&#8217;d stay here, if there was room for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to board here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t put it to myself that way. I thought
perhaps you&#8217;d be glad to have me. I&#8217;m handy. I
can cook, I can sew, and I&#8217;m quite cheerful and kind.
Then there&#8217;s George&mdash;little George. I thought you&#8217;d
like to have your grandson here with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lived without him&mdash;or his father&mdash;for eight
years, an&#8217; I could bear it awhile yet, mebbe.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a half-choking sound from the old woman
in the rocking-chair, but she did not speak, though her
knitting dropped into her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you knew us better, perhaps you&#8217;d like us
better,&#8221; rejoined Cassy, gently. &#8220;We&#8217;re both pretty
easy to get on with, and we see the bright side of things.
He has a wonderful disposition, has George.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to like you any better,&#8221; said the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
man, getting to his feet. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to give you
any rights here. I&#8217;ve thought it out, and my mind&#8217;s
made up. You can&#8217;t come it over me. You ruined
my boy&#8217;s life and sent him to his grave. He&#8217;d have
lived to be an old man out here; but you spoiled him.
You trapped him into marrying you, with your kicking
and your comic songs, and your tricks of the stage, and
you parted us&mdash;parted him and me forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was your fault. George wanted to make it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With you!&#8221; The old man&#8217;s voice rose shrilly, the
bitterness and passion of years was shooting high in
the narrow confines of his mind. The geyser of his
prejudice and antipathy was furiously alive. &#8220;To
come back with you that ruined him and broke up
my family, and made my life like bitter aloes! No!
And if I wouldn&#8217;t have him with you, do you think
I&#8217;ll have you without him? By the God of Israel,
no!&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Andy was now standing up behind the stove
intently watching, his face grim and sombre; Aunt
Kate sat with both hands gripping the arms of the
rocker.</p>
<p>Cassy got slowly to her feet. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been as straight a
woman as your mother or your wife ever was,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and all the world knows it. I&#8217;m poor&mdash;and I might
have been rich. I was true to myself before I married
George, and I was true to George after, and all I earned
he shared; and I&#8217;ve got little left. The mining stock
I bought with what I saved went smash, and I&#8217;m poor
as I was when I started to work for myself. I can
work awhile yet; but I wanted to see if I could fit in out
here and get well again, and have my boy fixed in the
house of his grandfather. That&#8217;s the way I&#8217;m placed,
and that&#8217;s how I came. But give a dog a bad name&mdash;ah,
you shame your dead boy in thinking bad of me!
I didn&#8217;t ruin him. I didn&#8217;t kill him. He never came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
to any bad through me. I helped him; he was happy.
Why, I&mdash;&#8221; She stopped suddenly, putting a hand to her
mouth. &#8220;Go on, say what you want to say, and let&#8217;s understand
once for all,&#8221; she added, with a sudden sharpness.</p>
<p>Abel Baragar drew himself up. &#8220;Well, I say this.
I&#8217;ll give you three thousand dollars, and you can go
somewhere else to live. I&#8217;ll keep the boy here. That&#8217;s
what I&#8217;ve fixed in my mind to do. You can go, and
the boy stays. I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to live with you that spoiled
George&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of the woman dilated, she trembled with a
sudden rush of anger, then stood still, staring in front
of her without a word. Black Andy stepped from behind
the stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to stay here, Cassy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;here
where you have rights as good as any, and better than
any, if it comes to that.&#8221; He turned to his father.
&#8220;You thought a lot of George,&#8221; he added. &#8220;He was
the apple of your eye. He had a soft tongue, and
most people liked him; but George was foolish&mdash;I&#8217;ve
known it all these years. George was pretty foolish.
He gambled, he bet at races, he speculated&mdash;wild. You
didn&#8217;t know it. He took ten thousand dollars of your
money, got from the Wonegosh farm he sold for you.
He&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Cassy Mavor started forward with a cry, but Black
Andy waved her down.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to tell it. George lost your ten
thousand dollars, dad, gambling, racing, speculating.
He told her&mdash;Cassy&mdash;two days after they was married,
and she took the money she earned on the stage and
give it to him to pay you back on the quiet through
the bank. You never knew, but that&#8217;s the kind of boy
your son George was, and that&#8217;s the kind of wife he
had. George told me all about it when I went East
six years ago.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>He came over to Cassy and stood beside her. &#8220;I&#8217;m
standing by George&#8217;s wife,&#8221; he said, taking her hand,
while she shut her eyes in her misery&mdash;had she not
hid her husband&#8217;s wrong-doing all these years?&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
standing by her. If it hadn&#8217;t been for that ten thousand
dollars she paid back for George, you&#8217;d have been
swamped, when the Syndicate got after you, and we
wouldn&#8217;t have had Lumley&#8217;s place, nor this, nor anything.
I guess she&#8217;s got rights here, dad, as good as any.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man sank slowly into a chair. &#8220;George&mdash;George
stole from me&mdash;stole money from me!&#8221; he
whispered. His face was white. His pride and vainglory
were broken. He was a haggard, shaken figure.
His self-righteousness was levelled in the dust.</p>
<p>With sudden impulse Cassy stole over to him and
took his hand and held it tight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t! Don&#8217;t feel so bad!&#8221; she said. &#8220;He was
weak and wild then. But he was all right afterward.
He was happy with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve owed Cassy this for a good many years, dad,&#8221;
said Black Andy, &#8220;and it had to be paid. She&#8217;s got
better stuff in her than any Baragar.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>An hour later the old man said to Cassy at the door
of her room: &#8220;You got to stay here and git well. It&#8217;s
yours, the same as the rest of us&mdash;what&#8217;s here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he went down-stairs and sat with Aunt Kate by
the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess she&#8217;s a good woman,&#8221; he said, at last. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t use her right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been lucky with your women-folk,&#8221; Aunt
Kate answered, quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been lucky,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I dunno if
I deserve it. Mebbe not. Do you think she&#8217;ll git well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a healing air out here,&#8221; Aunt Kate answered, and
listened to the wood of the house snapping in the sharp frost.</p>

<h2>MARCILE</h2>
</div>

<p>That the day was beautiful, that the harvest of the
West had been a great one, that the salmon-fishing
had been larger than ever before, that gold had been
found in the Yukon, made no difference to Jacques
Grassette, for he was in the condemned cell of Bindon
Jail, living out those days which pass so swiftly between
the verdict of the jury and the last slow walk with the
Sheriff.</p>
<p>He sat with his back to the stone wall, his hands on
his knees, looking straight before him. All that met
his physical gaze was another stone wall, but with his
mind&#8217;s eye he was looking beyond it into spaces far
away. His mind was seeing a little house with dormer-windows,
and a steep roof on which the snow could not
lodge in winter-time; with a narrow stoop in front
where one could rest of an evening, the day&#8217;s work
done; the stone-and-earth oven near by in the open,
where the bread for a family of twenty was baked; the
wooden plough tipped against the fence, to wait the
&#8220;fall&#8221; cultivation; the big iron cooler in which the sap
from the maple-trees was boiled, in the days when the
snow thawed and spring opened the heart of the wood;
the flash of the sickle and the scythe hard by; the fields
of the little, narrow farm running back from the St.
Lawrence like a riband; and, out on the wide stream,
the great rafts with their riverine population floating
down to Michelin&#8217;s mill-yards.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>For hours he had sat like this, unmoving, his gnarled
red hands clamping each leg as though to hold him
steady while he gazed; and he saw himself as a little
lad, barefooted, doing chores, running after the shaggy,
troublesome pony which would let him catch it when no
one else could, and, with only a halter on, galloping
wildly back to the farm-yard, to be hitched up in the
cariole which had once belonged to the old Seigneur.
He saw himself as a young man back from &#8220;the States,&#8221;
where he had been working in the mills, regarded
austerely by little Father Roche, who had given him
his first Communion&mdash;for, down in Massachusetts he
had learned to wear his curly hair plastered down on
his forehead, smoke bad cigars, and drink &#8220;old Bourbon,&#8221;
to bet and to gamble, and be a figure at horse-races.</p>
<p>Then he saw himself, his money all gone, but the luck
still with him, at Mass on the Sunday before going to
the backwoods lumber-camp for the winter, as boss of a
hundred men. He had a way with him, and he had
brains, had Jacques Grassette, and he could manage
men, as Michelin the lumber-king himself had found in
a great river-row and strike, when bloodshed seemed
certain. Even now the ghost of a smile played at his
lips as he recalled the surprise of the old <i>habitants</i> and
of Father Roche when he was chosen for this responsible
post; for to run a great lumber-camp well, hundreds of
miles from civilisation, where there is no visible law,
no restraints of ordinary organized life, and where men,
for seven months together, never saw a woman or
a child, and ate pork and beans, and drank white
whiskey, was a task of administration as difficult as
managing a small republic new-created out of violent
elements of society. But Michelin was right, and the
old Seigneur, Sir Henri Robitaille, who was a judge of
men, knew he was right, as did also Hennepin the
school-master, whose despair Jacques had been, for he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
never worked at his lessons as a boy, and yet he absorbed
Latin and mathematics by some sure but unexplainable
process. &#8220;Ah, if you would but work, Jacques, you
<i>vaurien</i>, I would make a great man of you,&#8221; Hennepin
had said to him more than once; but this had made
no impression on Jacques. It was more to the point
that the ground-hogs and black squirrels and pigeons
were plentiful in Casanac Woods.</p>
<p>And so he thought as he stood at the door of the
Church of St. Francis on that day before going &#8220;out
back&#8221; to the lumber-camp. He had reached the summit
of greatness&mdash;to command men. That was more than
wealth or learning, and as he spoke to the old Seigneur
going in to Mass, he still thought so, for the Seigneur&#8217;s
big house and the servants and the great gardens had no
charm for him. The horses&mdash;that was another thing;
but there would be plenty of horses in the lumber-camp;
and, on the whole, he felt himself rather superior to the
old Seigneur, who now was Lieutenant-Governor of the
province in which lay Bindon Jail.</p>
<p>At the door of the Church of St. Francis he had
stretched himself up with good-natured pride, for he
was by nature gregarious and friendly, but with a
temper quick and strong, and even savage when roused;
though Michelin the lumber-king did not know that when
he engaged him as boss, having seen him only at the
one critical time when his superior brain and will saw
its chance to command and had no personal interest in
the strife. He had been a miracle of coolness then, and
his six-foot-two of pride and muscle was taking natural
tribute at the door of the Church of St. Francis, where
he waited till nearly every one had entered, and Father
Roche&#8217;s voice could be heard in the Mass.</p>

THEN HAD HAPPENED THE REAL EVENT OF HIS LIFE<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>Then had happened the real event of his life: a black-eyed,
rose-cheeked girl went by with her mother, hurrying
in to Mass. As she passed him their eyes met, and
his blood leaped in his veins. He had never seen her
before, and, in a sense, he had never seen any woman
before. He had danced with many a one, and kissed a
few in the old days among the flax-beaters, at the
harvesting, in the gayeties of a wedding, and also down
in Massachusetts. That, however, was a different thing,
which he forgot an hour after; but this was the beginning
of the world for him; for he knew now, of a sudden,
what life was, what home meant, why &#8220;old folks&#8221; slaved
for their children, and mothers wept when girls married
or sons went away from home to bigger things; why in
there, in at Mass, so many were praying for all the
people and thinking only of one. All in a moment it
came&mdash;and stayed; and he spoke to her, to Marcile, that
very night, and he spoke also to her father, Valloir the
farrier, the next morning by lamplight, before he started
for the woods. He would not be gainsaid, nor take no
for an answer, nor accept, as a reason for refusal, that
she was only sixteen, and that he did not know her, for
she had been away with a childless aunt since she was
three. That she had fourteen brothers and sisters who
had to be fed and cared for did not seem to weigh with
the farrier. That was an affair of <i>le bon Dieu</i>, and enough
would be provided for them all as heretofore&mdash;one could
make little difference; and though Jacques was a very
good match, considering his prospects and his favor with
the lumber-king, Valloir had a kind of fear of him, and
could not easily promise his beloved Marcile, the flower
of his flock, to a man of whom the priest so strongly
disapproved. But it was a new sort of Jacques Grassette
who, that morning, spoke to him with the simplicity and
eagerness of a child; and the suddenly conceived gift of
a pony stallion, which every man in the parish envied
Jacques, won Valloir over; and Jacques went &#8220;away
back&#8221; with the first timid kiss of Marcile Valloir burning
on his cheek.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
&#8220;Well, bagosh, you are a wonder!&#8221; said Jacques&#8217;
father, when he told him the news, and saw Jacques
jump into the cariole and drive away.</p>
<p>Here in prison, this, too, Jacques saw&mdash;this scene; and
then the wedding in the spring, and the tour through the
parishes for days together, lads and lasses journeying
with them; and afterward the new home with a bigger
stoop than any other in the village, with some old,
gnarled crab-apple-trees and lilac bushes, and four years
of happiness, and a little child that died; and all the
time Jacques rising in the esteem of Michelin the lumber-king,
and sent on inspections, and to organize camps;
for weeks, sometimes for months, away from the house
behind the lilac bushes&mdash;and then the end of it all, sudden
and crushing and unredeemable.</p>
<p>Jacques came back one night and found the house
empty. Marcile had gone to try her luck with another
man.</p>
<p>That was the end of the upward career of Jacques
Grassette. He went out upon a savage hunt which
brought him no quarry, for the man and the woman had
disappeared as completely as though they had been
swallowed by the sea. And here, at last, he was waiting
for the day when he must settle a bill for a human life
taken in passion and rage.</p>
<p>His big frame seemed out of place in the small cell,
and the watcher sitting near him, to whom he had not
addressed a word nor replied to a question since the
watching began, seemed an insignificant factor in the
scene. Never had a prisoner been more self-contained,
or rejected more completely all those ministrations of
humanity which relieve the horrible isolation of the
condemned cell. Grassette&#8217;s isolation was complete.
He lived in a dream, did what little there was to do in
a dark abstraction, and sat hour after hour, as he was
sitting now, piercing, with a brain at once benumbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
to all outer things and afire with inward things, those
realms of memory which are infinite in a life of forty
years.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sacré!</i>&#8221; he muttered at last, and a shiver seemed
to pass through him from head to foot; then an ugly and
evil oath fell from his lips, which made his watcher
shrink back appalled, for he also was a Catholic, and
had been chosen of purpose, in the hope that he might
have an influence on this revolted soul. It had, however,
been of no use, and Grassette had refused the
advances and ministrations of the little good priest,
Father Laflamme, who had come from the coast of
purpose to give him the offices of the Church. Silent,
obdurate, sullen, he had looked the priest straight in
the face, and had said, in broken English, &#8220;<i>Non</i>, I pay
my bill. <i>Nom de diable!</i> I will say my own Mass, light
my own candle, go my own way. I have too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, as he sat glooming, after his outbreak of oaths,
there came a rattling noise at the door, the grinding
of a key in the lock, the shooting of bolts, and a face
appeared at the little wicket in the door. Then the door
opened, and the Sheriff stepped inside, accompanied
by a white-haired, stately old man. At sight of this
second figure&mdash;the Sheriff had come often before, and
would come for one more doleful walk with him&mdash;Grassette
started. His face, which had never whitened
in all the dismal and terrorizing doings of the capture
and the trial and sentence, though it had flushed with
rage more than once, now turned a little pale, for it
seemed as if this old man had stepped out of the visions
which had just passed before his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;His Honor, the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Henri
Robitaille, has come to speak with you.... Stand up!&#8221;
the Sheriff added, sharply, as Grassette kept his seat.</p>
<p>Grassette&#8217;s face flushed with anger, for the prison had
not broken his spirit; then he got up slowly. &#8220;I not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
stand up for you,&#8221; he growled at the Sheriff; &#8220;I stand
up for him.&#8221; He jerked his head toward Sir Henri
Robitaille. This grand Seigneur, with Michelin had believed
in him in those far-off days which he had just
been seeing over again, and all his boyhood and young
manhood was rushing back on him. But now it was
the Governor who turned pale, seeing who the criminal
was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jacques Grassette!&#8221; he cried, in consternation and
emotion, for under another name the murderer had been
tried and sentenced, nor had his identity been established&mdash;the
case was so clear, the defence had been
perfunctory, and Quebec was very far away!</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu&#8217;!&#8221; was the respectful response, and Grassette&#8217;s
fingers twitched.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my sister&#8217;s son you killed, Grassette,&#8221; said
the Governor, in a low, strained voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu</i>!&#8221; said Grassette, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know, Grassette,&#8221; the Governor went on&mdash;&#8220;I
did not know it was you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you come, m&#8217;sieu&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call him &#8216;your Honor,&#8217;&#8221; said the Sheriff, sharply.</p>
<p>Grassette&#8217;s face hardened, and his look, turned upon
the Sheriff, was savage and forbidding. &#8220;I will speak
as it please me. Who are you? What do I care? To
hang me&mdash;that is your business; but, for the rest, you
spik to me differen&#8217;! Who are you? Your father kep&#8217;
a tavern for thieves, <i>vous savez bien</i>!&#8221; It was true
that the Sheriff&#8217;s father had had no savory reputation
in the West.</p>
<p>The Governor turned his head away in pain and
trouble, for the man&#8217;s rage was not a thing to see&mdash;and
they both came from the little parish of St. Francis, and
had passed many an hour together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Grassette,&#8221; he said, gently. &#8220;Call me
what you will. You&#8217;ve got no feeling against me; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
I can say with truth that I don&#8217;t want your life for the
life you took.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grassette&#8217;s breast heaved. &#8220;He put me out of my
work, the man I kill. He pass the word against me, he
hunt me out of the mountains, he call&mdash;<i>tête de diable</i>!
he call me a name so bad. Everything swim in my
head, and I kill him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Governor made a protesting gesture. &#8220;I understand.
I am glad his mother was dead. But do you
not think how sudden it was? Now here, in the thick
of life, then, out there, beyond this world in the dark&mdash;in
purgatory.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brave old man had accomplished what every one
else, priest, lawyer, Sheriff, and watcher, had failed to
do: he had shaken Grassette out of his blank isolation
and obdurate unrepentance, had touched some chord of
recognizable humanity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is done&mdash;<i>bien</i>, I pay for it,&#8221; responded Grassette,
setting his jaw. &#8220;It is two deaths for me. Waiting
and remembering, and then with the Sheriff there the
other&mdash;so quick, and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Governor looked at him for some moments
without speaking. The Sheriff intervened again officiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;His Honor has come to say something important
to you,&#8221; he remarked, oracularly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold you&mdash;does he need a Sheriff to tell him when
to spik?&#8221; was Grassette&#8217;s surly comment. Then he
turned to the Governor. &#8220;Let us speak in French,&#8221; he
said, in <i>patois</i>. &#8220;This rope-twister will not understan&#8217;.
He is no good&mdash;I spit at him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Governor nodded, and, despite the Sheriff&#8217;s
protest, they spoke in French, Grassette with his eyes
intently fixed on the other, eagerly listening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come,&#8221; said the Governor, &#8220;to say to you,
Grassette, that you still have a chance of life.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>He paused, and Grassette&#8217;s face took on a look of
bewilderment and vague anxiety. A chance of life&mdash;what
did it mean?</p>
<p>&#8220;Reprieve?&#8221; he asked, in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>The Governor shook his head. &#8220;Not yet; but there
is a chance. Something has happened. A man&#8217;s life
is in danger, or it may be he is dead; but more likely
he is alive. You took a life; perhaps you can save
one now. Keeley&#8217;s Gulch, the mine there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have found it&mdash;gold?&#8221; asked Grassette, his
eyes staring. He was forgetting for a moment where
and what he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;He went to find it, the man whose life is in danger.
He had heard from a trapper who had been a miner
once. While he was there a landslip came, and the
opening to the mine was closed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were two ways in. Which one did he take?&#8221;
cried Grassette.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only one he could take, the only one he or
any one else knew. You know the other way in&mdash;you
only, they say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I found it&mdash;the easier, quick way in; a year ago I
found it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it near the other entrance?&#8221;</p>
<p>Grassette shook his head. &#8220;A mile away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the man is alive&mdash;and we think he is&mdash;you are the
only person that can save him. I have telegraphed the
Government. They do not promise, but they will reprieve,
and save your life if you find the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alive or dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alive or dead, for the act would be the same. I
have an order to take you to the Gulch, if you will go;
and I am sure that you will have your life if you do it.
I will promise&mdash;ah, yes, Grassette, but it shall be so!
Public opinion will demand it. You will do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To go free&mdash;<i>altogether</i>?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, but if your life is saved, Grassette?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dark face flushed, then grew almost repulsive
again in its sullenness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Life&mdash;and this, in prison, shut in year after year!
To do always what some one else wills, to be a slave to
a warder! To have men like that over me that have
been a boss of men&mdash;wasn&#8217;t it that drove me to kill?&mdash;to
be treated like dirt! And to go on with this, while
outside there is free life, and to go where you will at
your own price&mdash;no! What do I care for life? What
is it to me! To live like this&mdash;ah, I would break my
head against these stone walls, I would choke myself
with my own hands! If I stayed here, I would kill
again&mdash;I would kill&mdash;kill!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then to go free altogether&mdash;that would be the wish
of all the world, if you save this man&#8217;s life, if it can be
saved. Will you not take the chance? We all have to
die some time or other, Grassette, some sooner, some
later; and when you go, will you not want to take to
God in your hands a life saved for a life taken? Have
you forgotten God, Grassette? We used to remember
Him in the Church of St. Francis down there at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, in which Grassette&#8217;s
head was thrust forward, his eyes staring into space.
The old Seigneur had touched a vulnerable corner in
his nature.</p>
<p>Presently he said in a low voice: &#8220;To be free altogether!...
What is his name? Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His name is Bignold,&#8221; the Governor answered. He
turned to the Sheriff inquiringly. &#8220;That is it, is it
not?&#8221; he asked, in English, again.</p>
<p>&#8220;James Tarran Bignold,&#8221; answered the Sheriff.</p>
<p>The effect of these words upon Grassette was remarkable.
His body appeared to stiffen, his face became
rigid, he stared at the Governor blankly, appalled; the
color left his face, and his mouth opened with a curious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
and revolting grimace. The others drew back, startled,
and watched him.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sang de Dieu</i>!&#8221; he murmured at last, with a sudden
gesture of misery and rage.</p>
<p>Then the Governor understood: he remembered that
the name just given by the Sheriff and himself was the
name of the Englishman who had carried off Grassette&#8217;s
wife years ago. He stepped forward and was about
to speak, but changed his mind. He would leave it all
to Grassette; he would not let the Sheriff know the
truth, unless Grassette himself disclosed the situation.
He looked at Grassette with a look of poignant pity and
interest combined. In his own placid life he had never
had any tragic happening, his blood had run coolly, his
days had been blessed by an urbane fate; such scenes
as this were but a spectacle to him; there was no answering
chord of human suffering in his own breast to
make him realize what Grassette was undergoing
now; but he had read widely, he had been an acute
observer of the world and its happenings, and he had
a natural human sympathy which had made many a
man and woman eternally grateful to him.</p>
<p>What would Grassette do? It was a problem which
had no precedent, and the solution would be a revelation
of the human mind and heart. What would the man do?</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is all this, Grassette?&#8221; asked the Sheriff,
brusquely. His official and officious intervention, behind
which was the tyranny of the little man, given a
power which he was incapable of wielding wisely, would
have roused Grassette to a savage reply a half-hour
before, but now it was met by a contemptuous wave of
the hand, and Grassette kept his eyes fixed on the
Governor.</p>
<p>&#8220;James Tarran Bignold!&#8221; Grassette said, harshly,
with eyes that searched the Governor&#8217;s face; but they
found no answering look there. The Governor, then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
did not remember that tragedy of his home and hearth,
and the man who had made of him an Ishmael. Still,
Bignold had been almost a stranger in the parish, and
it was not curious if the Governor had forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bignold!&#8221; he repeated, but the Governor gave no
response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Bignold is his name, Grassette,&#8221; said the
Sheriff. &#8220;You took a life, and now, if you save one,
that&#8217;ll balance things. As the Governor says, there&#8217;ll
be a reprieve anyhow. It&#8217;s pretty near <i>the day</i>, and this
isn&#8217;t a bad world to kick in, so long as you kick with
one leg on the ground, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Governor hastily intervened upon the Sheriff&#8217;s
brutal remarks. &#8220;There is no time to be lost, Grassette.
He has been ten days in the mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grassette&#8217;s was not a slow brain. For a man of such
physical and bodily bulk, he had more talents than are
generally given. If his brain had been slower, his hand
also would have been slower to strike. But his intelligence
had been surcharged with hate these many years,
and since the day he had been deserted it had ceased
to control his actions&mdash;a passionate and reckless wilfulness
had governed it. But now, after the first shock
and stupefaction, it seemed to go back to where it was
before Marcile went from him, gather up the force and
intelligence it had then, and come forward again to this
supreme moment, with all that life&#8217;s harsh experiences
had done for it, with the education that misery and
misdoing give. Revolutions are often the work of
instants, not years, and the crucial test and problem by
which Grassette was now faced had lifted him into a
new atmosphere, with a new capacity alive in him. A
moment ago his eyes had been bloodshot and swimming
with hatred and passion; now they grew, almost suddenly,
hard and lurking and quiet, with a strange,
penetrating force and inquiry in them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bignold&mdash;where does he come from?&mdash;What is he?&#8221;
he asked the Sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is an Englishman; he&#8217;s only been out here
a few months. He&#8217;s been shooting and prospecting;
but he&#8217;s a better shooter than a prospector. He&#8217;s a
stranger; that&#8217;s why all the folks out here want to save
him if it&#8217;s possible. It&#8217;s pretty hard dying in a strange
land far away from all that&#8217;s yours. Maybe he&#8217;s got
a wife waiting for him over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu</i>!&#8221; said Grassette, with suppressed
malice, under his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe there&#8217;s a wife waiting for him, and there&#8217;s
her to think of. The West&#8217;s hospitable, and this thing
has taken hold of it; the West wants to save this stranger,
and it&#8217;s waiting for you, Grassette, to do its work
for it, you being the only man that can do it, the only
one that knows the other secret way into Keeley&#8217;s
Gulch. Speak right out, Grassette. It&#8217;s your chance
for life. Speak out quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last three words were uttered in the old slave-driving
tone, though the earlier part of the speech had
been delivered oracularly, and had brought again to
Grassette&#8217;s eyes the reddish, sullen look which had made
them, a little while before, like those of some wounded,
angered animal at bay; but it vanished slowly, and
there was silence for a moment. The Sheriff&#8217;s words
had left no vestige of doubt in Grassette&#8217;s mind. This
Bignold was the man who had taken Marcile away, first
to the English province, then into the States, where he
had lost track of them, then over to England. Marcile&mdash;where
was Marcile now?</p>
<p>In Keeley&#8217;s Gulch was the man who could tell him,
the man who had ruined his home and his life. Dead
or alive, he was in Keeley&#8217;s Gulch, the man who knew
where Marcile was; and if he knew where Marcile was,
and if she was alive, and he was outside these prison
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
walls, what would he do to her? And if he was outside
these prison walls, and in the Gulch, and the man
was there alive before him, what would he do?</p>
<p>Outside these prison walls&mdash;to be out there in the
sun, where life would be easier to give up, if it had to be
given up! An hour ago he had been drifting on a sea
of apathy, and had had his fill of life. An hour ago he
had had but one desire, and that was to die fighting,
and he had even pictured to himself a struggle in this
narrow cell where he would compel them to kill him,
and so in any case let him escape the rope. Now he
was suddenly brought face to face with the great central
issue of his life, and the end, whatever that end might
be, could not be the same in meaning, though it might
be the same concretely. If he elected to let things
be, then Bignold would die out there in the Gulch,
starved, anguished, and alone. If he went, he could
save his own life by saving Bignold, if Bignold was
alive; or he could go&mdash;and not save Bignold&#8217;s life or
his own! What would he do?</p>
<p>The Governor watched him with a face controlled to
quietness, but with an anxiety which made him pale in
spite of himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do, Grassette?&#8221; he said, at last, in a
low voice and with a step forward to him. &#8220;Will you
not help to clear your conscience by doing this thing?
You don&#8217;t want to try and spite the world by not doing
it. You can make a lot of your life yet, if you are set
free. Give yourself and give the world a chance. You
haven&#8217;t used it right. Try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grassette imagined that the Governor did not remember
who Bignold was, and that this was an appeal
against his despair, and against revenging himself on
the community which had applauded his sentence. If
he went to the Gulch, no one would know or could suspect
the true situation, every one would be unprepared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
for that moment when Bignold and he would face each
other&mdash;and all that would happen then.</p>
<p>Where was Marcile? Only Bignold knew. Alive or
dead? Only Bignold knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bien</i>, I will do it, m&#8217;sieu&#8217;,&#8221; he said to the Governor.
&#8220;I am to go alone&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Sheriff shook his head. &#8220;No; two warders will
go with you&mdash;and myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>A strange look passed over Grassette&#8217;s face. He
seemed to hesitate for a moment, then he said again:
&#8220;<i>Bon</i>, I will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there is, of course, the doctor,&#8221; said the
Sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bon</i>!&#8221; said Grassette. &#8220;What time is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve o&#8217;clock,&#8221; answered the Sheriff, and made
a motion to the warder to open the door of the cell.</p>
<p>&#8220;By sundown!&#8221; Grassette said, and he turned with a
determined gesture to leave the cell.</p>
<p>At the gate of the prison a fresh, sweet air caught
his face. Involuntarily he drew in a great draught of
it, and his eyes seemed to gaze out, almost wonderingly,
over the grass and the trees to the boundless
horizon. Then he became aware of the shouts of the
crowd&mdash;shouts of welcome. This same crowd had
greeted him with shouts of execration when he had left
the court-house after his sentence. He stood still for
a moment and looked at them, as it were only half
comprehending that they were cheering him now, and
that voices were saying, &#8220;Bravo, Grassette! Save him,
and we&#8217;ll save you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cheer upon cheer, but he took no notice. He walked
like one in a dream&mdash;a long, strong step. He turned
neither to left nor right, not even when the friendly
voice of one who had worked with him bade him
&#8220;Cheer up and do the trick.&#8221; He was busy working
out a problem which no one but himself could solve.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
He was only half conscious of his surroundings; he was
moving in a kind of detached world of his own, where
the warders and the Sheriff and those who followed were
almost abstract and unreal figures. He was living with
a past which had been everlastingly distant, and had now
become a vivid and buffeting present. He returned no
answers to the questions addressed to him, and would
not talk, save when for a little while they dismounted
from their horses and sat under the shade of a great
ash-tree for a few moments and snatched a mouthful of
luncheon. Then he spoke a little and asked some
questions, but lapsed into a moody silence afterward.
His life and nature were being passed through a fiery
crucible. In all the years that had gone he had had an
ungovernable desire to kill both Bignold and Marcile if
he ever met them&mdash;a primitive, savage desire to blot
them out of life and being. His fingers had ached for
Marcile&#8217;s neck, that neck in which he had lain his face
so often in the transient, unforgettable days of their
happiness. If she was alive now!&mdash;if she was still alive!</p>
<p>Her story was hidden there in Keeley&#8217;s Gulch with
Bignold, and he was galloping hard to reach his foe. As
he went, by some strange alchemy of human experience,
by that new birth of his brain, the world seemed different
from what it had ever been before, at least
since the day when he had found an empty home and a
shamed hearthstone. He got a new feeling toward it,
and life appealed to him as a thing that might have
been so well worth living! But since that was not to
be, then he would see what he could do to get compensation
for all that he had lost, to take toll for the
thing that had spoiled him, and given him a savage nature
and a raging temper, which had driven him at last to kill
a man who, in no real sense, had injured him.</p>
<p>Mile after mile they journeyed, a troop of interested
people coming after; the sun and the clear, sweet air, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
waving grass, the occasional clearings where settlers had
driven in the tent-pegs of home; the forest now and then
swallowing them, the mountains rising above them like
a blank wall, and then suddenly opening out before
them; and the rustle and scamper of squirrels and
coyotes; and over their heads the whistle of birds, the
slow beat of wings of great wild-fowl. The tender sap
of youth was in this glowing and alert new world, and,
by sudden contrast with the prison walls which he had
just left behind, the earth seemed recreated, unfamiliar,
compelling, and companionable. Strange that in all
the years that had been since he had gone back to his
abandoned home to find Marcile gone, the world had
had no beauty, no lure for him. In the splendor of it
all he had only raged and stormed, hating his fellow-man,
waiting, however hopelessly, for the day when he
should see Marcile and the man who had taken her
from him. And yet now, under the degradation of his
crime and its penalty, and the unmanning influence of
being the helpless victim of the iron power of the law,
rigid, ugly, and demoralizing&mdash;now with the solution of
his life&#8217;s great problem here before him in the hills, with
the man for whom he had waited so long caverned in
the earth but a hand-reach away, as it were, his wrongs
had taken a new manifestation in him, and the thing
that kept crying out in him every moment was, Where
is Marcile?</p>
<p>It was four o&#8217;clock when they reached the pass which
only Grassette knew, the secret way into the Gulch.
There was two hours&#8217; walking through the thick,
primeval woods, where few had ever been, except the
ancient tribes which had once lorded it here; then came
a sudden drop into the earth, a short travel through
a dim cave, and afterward a sheer wall of stone enclosing
a ravine where the rocks on either side nearly
met overhead.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>Here Grassette gave the signal to shout aloud, and
the voice of the Sheriff called out: &#8220;Hello, Bignold!
Hello! Hello, Bignold! Are you there?&mdash;Hello!&#8221; His
voice rang out clear and piercing, and then came a
silence&mdash;a long, anxious silence. Again the voice rang
out: &#8220;Hello! Hello-o-o! Bignold! Bigno-o-ld!&#8221;</p>
<p>They strained their ears. Grassette was flat on the
ground, his ear to the earth. Suddenly he got to his
feet, his face set, his eyes glittering.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is there beyon&#8217;&mdash;I hear him,&#8221; he said, pointing
farther down the Gulch. &#8220;Water&mdash;he is near it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We heard nothing,&#8221; said the Sheriff&mdash;&#8220;not a sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear ver&#8217; good. He is alive. I hear him&mdash;so,&#8221;
responded Grassette; and his face had a strange, fixed
look which the others interpreted to be agitation at the
thought that he had saved his own life by finding
Bignold&mdash;and alive; which would put his own salvation
beyond doubt.</p>
<p>He broke away from them and hurried down the
Gulch. The others followed hard after, the Sheriff and
the warders close behind; but he outstripped them.</p>
<p>Suddenly he stopped and stood still, looking at
something on the ground. They saw him lean forward
and his hands stretched out with a fierce gesture. It was
the attitude of a wild animal ready to spring.</p>
<p>They were beside him in an instant, and saw at his
feet Bignold worn to a skeleton, with eyes starting from
his head and fixed on Grassette in agony and stark fear.</p>
<p>The Sheriff stooped to lift Bignold up, but Grassette
waved them back with a fierce gesture, standing over
the dying man.</p>
<p>&#8220;He spoil my home. He break me&mdash;I have my bill
to settle here,&#8221; he said, in a voice hoarse and harsh. &#8220;It
is so? It is so&mdash;eh? Spik!&#8221; he said to Bignold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; came feebly from the shrivelled lips. &#8220;Water!
Water!&#8221; the wretched man gasped. &#8220;I&#8217;m dying!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>A sudden change came over Grassette. &#8220;Water&mdash;queeck!&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>The Sheriff stooped and held a hatful of water to
Bignold&#8217;s lips, while another poured brandy from a flask
into the water.</p>
<p>Grassette watched them eagerly. When the dying
man had swallowed a little of the spirit and water,
Grassette leaned over him again, and the others drew
away. They realized that these two men had an account
to settle, and there was no need for Grassette to take
revenge, for Bignold was going fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stan&#8217; far back,&#8221; said Grassette, and they fell away.</p>
<p>Then he stooped down to the sunken, ashen face,
over which death was fast drawing its veil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marcile&mdash;where is Marcile?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>The dying man&#8217;s lips opened. &#8220;God forgive me&mdash;God
save my soul!&#8221; he whispered. He was not concerned
for Grassette now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Queeck&mdash;queeck, where is Marcile?&#8221; Grassette said,
sharply. &#8220;Come back, Bignold. Listen&mdash;where is Marcile?&#8221;</p>
<p>He strained to hear the answer. Bignold was going,
but his eyes opened again, however, for this call seemed
to pierce to his soul as it struggled to be free.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten years&mdash;since&mdash;I saw her,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Good
girl&mdash;Marcile. She loves you, but she&mdash;is afraid.&#8221; He
tried to say something more, but his tongue refused
its office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is she?&mdash;spik!&#8221; commanded Grassette, in a
tone of pleading and agony now.</p>
<p>Once more the flying spirit came back. A hand
made a motion toward his pocket, then lay still.</p>
<p>Grassette felt hastily in the dead man&#8217;s pocket, drew
forth a letter, and with half-blinded eyes read the few
lines it contained. It was dated from a hospital in
New York, and was signed, &#8220;Nurse Marcile.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>With a groan of relief Grassette stood staring at the
dead man. When the others came to him again, his
lips were moving, but they did not hear what he was
saying. They took up the body and moved away with
it up the ravine.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Grassette. You&#8217;ll be a free man,&#8221; said
the Sheriff.</p>
<p>Grassette did not answer. He was thinking how
long it would take him to get to Marcile, when he was
free.</p>
<p>He had a true vision of beginning life again with
Marcile.</p>

<p>Athabasca in the Far North is the scene of this
story&mdash;Athabasca, one of the most beautiful countries
in the world in summer, but a cold, bare land in winter.
Yet even in winter it is not so bleak and bitter as the
districts southwest of it, for the Chinook winds steal
through from the Pacific and temper the fierceness of the
frozen Rockies. Yet forty and fifty degrees below zero
is cold, after all, and July strawberries in this wild Northland
are hardly compensation for seven months of ice
and snow, no matter how clear and blue the sky, how
sweet the sun during its short journey in the day. Some
days, too, the sun may not be seen even when there is no
storm, because of the fine, white, powdered frost in the
air.</p>
<p>A day like this is called a <i>poudre</i> day; and woe to
the man who tempts it unthinkingly, because the light
makes the delicate mist of frost shine like silver. For
that powder bites the skin white in short order, and
sometimes reckless men lose ears or noses or hands
under its sharp caress. But when it really storms in
that Far North, then neither man nor beast should be
abroad&mdash;not even the Eskimo dogs; though times and
seasons can scarcely be chosen when travelling in
Athabasca, for a storm comes unawares. Upon the
plains you will see a cloud arising, not in the sky, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
from the ground&mdash;a billowy surf of drifting snow; then
another white billow from the sky will sweep down and
meet it, and you are caught between.</p>
<p>He who went to Athabasca to live a generation ago
had to ask himself if the long winter, spent chiefly
indoors, with, maybe, a little trading with the Indians,
meagre sport, and scant sun, savages and half-breeds the
only companions, and out of all touch with the outside
world, letters coming but once a year; with frozen fish
and meat, always the same, as the staple items in a
primitive fare; with danger from starvation and marauding
tribes; with endless monotony, in which men sometimes
go mad&mdash;he had to ask himself if these were to be
cheerfully endured because, in the short summer, the
air is heavenly, the rivers and lakes are full of fish, the
flotilla of canoes of the fur-hunters is pouring down,
and all is gayety and pleasant turmoil; because there
is good shooting in the autumn, and the smell of the land
is like a garden, and hardy fruits and flowers are at hand.</p>
<p>That is a question which was asked William Rufus
Holly once upon a time.</p>
<p>William Rufus Holly, often called &#8220;Averdoopoy,&#8221;
sometimes &#8220;Sleeping Beauty,&#8221; always Billy Rufus, had
had a good education. He had been to high-school and
to college, and he had taken one or two prizes <i>en route</i>
to graduation; but no fame travelled with him, save
that he was the laziest man of any college year for a
decade. He loved his little porringer, which is to say
that he ate a good deal; and he loved to read books,
which is not to say that he loved study; he hated getting
out of bed, and he was constantly gated for morning
chapel. More than once he had sweetly gone to sleep
over his examination papers. This is not to say that
he failed at his examinations&mdash;on the contrary, he
always succeeded; but he only did enough to pass and
no more; and he did not wish to do more than pass.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
His going to sleep at examinations was evidence that
he was either indifferent or self-indulgent, and it certainly
showed that he was without nervousness. He
invariably roused himself, or his professor roused him, a
half-hour before the papers should be handed in, and, as
it were, by a mathematical calculation he had always
done just enough to prevent him being plucked.</p>
<p>He slept at lectures, he slept in hall, he slept as he
waited his turn to go to the wicket in a cricket match,
and he invariably went to sleep afterward. He even
did so on the day he had made the biggest score in the
biggest game ever played between his college and the
pick of the country; but he first gorged himself with
cake and tea. The day he took his degree he had to be
dragged from a huge grandfather&#8217;s chair and forced along
in his ragged gown&mdash;&#8220;ten holes and twelve tatters&#8221;&mdash;to
the function in the convocation-hall. He looked
so fat and shiny, so balmy and sleepy, when he took his
degree and was handed his prize for a poem on Sir John
Franklin, that the public laughed, and the college men
in the gallery began singing&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Bye O, my baby,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Father will come to you soo-oon!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>He seemed not to care, but yawned in his hand as he
put his prize book under his arm through one of the
holes in his gown, and in two minutes was back in his
room, and in another five was fast asleep.</p>
<p>It was the general opinion that William Rufus Holly,
fat, yellow-haired, and twenty-four years old, was doomed
to failure in life, in spite of the fact that he had a little
income of a thousand dollars a year and had made
a century in an important game of cricket. Great,
therefore, was the surprise of the college, and afterward
of the Province, when, at the farewell dinner of the
graduates, Sleeping Beauty announced, between his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
little open-eyed naps, that he was going Far North as
a missionary.</p>
<p>At first it was thought he was joking, but when at
last, in his calm and dreamy look, they saw he meant
what he said, they arose and carried him round the room
on a chair, making impromptu songs as they travelled.
They toasted Billy Rufus again and again, some of
them laughing till they cried at the thought of Averdoopoy
going to the Arctic regions. But an uneasy seriousness
fell upon these &#8220;beautiful, bountiful, brilliant
boys,&#8221; as Holly called them later, when in a simple,
honest, but indolent speech he said he had applied for
ordination.</p>
<p>Six months later William Rufus Holly, a deacon in
holy orders, journeyed to Athabasca in the Far North.</p>
<p>On his long journey there was plenty of time to
think. He was embarked on a career which must
forever keep him in the wilds; for very seldom indeed
does a missionary of the North ever return to the
crowded cities or take a permanent part in civilized life.</p>
<p>What the loneliness of it would be he began to feel,
as for hours and hours he saw no human being on the
plains; in the thrilling stillness of the night; in fierce
storms in the woods, when his half-breed guides bent
their heads to meet the wind and rain, and did not
speak for hours; in the long, adventurous journey on
the river by the day, in the cry of the plaintive loon at
night; in the scant food for every meal. Yet what the
pleasure would be he felt in the joyous air, the exquisite
sunshine, the flocks of wild-fowl flying north, <i>honking</i> on
their course; in the song of the half-breeds as they ran
the rapids. Of course, he did not think these things
quite as they are written here&mdash;all at once and all
together; but in little pieces from time to time, feeling
them rather than saying them to himself.</p>
<p>At least he did understand how serious a thing it was,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
his going as a missionary into the Far North. Why did
he do it? Was it a whim, or the excited imagination
of youth, or that prompting which the young often have
to make the world better? Or was it a fine spirit of
adventure with a good heart behind it? Perhaps it was
a little of all these; but there was also something more,
and it was to his credit.</p>
<p>Lazy as William Rufus Holly had been at school and
college, he had still thought a good deal, even when he
seemed only sleeping; perhaps he thought more because
he slept so much, because he studied little and read a
great deal. He always knew what everybody thought&mdash;that
he would never do anything but play cricket till
he got too heavy to run, and then would sink into a
slothful, fat, and useless middle and old age; that his
life would be a failure. And he knew that they were
right; that if he stayed where he could live an easy life,
a fat and easy life he would lead; that in a few years he
would be good for nothing except to eat and sleep&mdash;no
more. One day, waking suddenly from a bad dream of
himself so fat as to be drawn about on a dray by monstrous
fat oxen with rings through their noses, led
by monkeys, he began to wonder what he should do&mdash;the
hardest thing to do; for only the hardest life could
possibly save him from failure, and, in spite of all, he
really did want to make something of his life. He had
been reading the story of Sir John Franklin&#8217;s Arctic
expedition, and all at once it came home to him that
the only thing for him to do was to go to the Far North
and stay there, coming back about once every ten years
to tell the people in the cities what was being done in
the wilds. Then there came the inspiration to write his
poem on Sir John Franklin, and he had done so, winning
the college prize for poetry. But no one had seen any
change in him in those months; and, indeed, there had
been little or no change, for he had an equable and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
practical, though imaginative, disposition, despite his
avoirdupois, and his new purpose did not stir him yet
from his comfortable sloth.</p>
<p>And in all the journey west and north he had not
been stirred greatly from his ease of body, for the
journey was not much harder than playing cricket
every day, and there were only the thrill of the beautiful
air, the new people, and the new scenes to rouse him.
As yet there was no great responsibility. He scarcely
realized what his life must be until one particular day.</p>
<p>Then Sleeping Beauty waked wide up, and from that
day lost the name. Till then he had looked and borne
himself like any other traveller, unrecognized as a
parson or &#8220;mikonaree.&#8221; He had not had prayers in
camp <i>en route</i>, he had not preached, he had held no
meetings. He was as yet William Rufus Holly, the
cricketer, the laziest dreamer of a college decade. His
religion was simple and practical; he had never had
any morbid ideas; he had lived a healthy, natural, and
honorable life, until he went for a mikonaree, and, if he
had no cant, he had not a clear idea of how many-sided,
how responsible, his life must be&mdash;until that one particular
day.</p>
<p>This is what happened then.</p>
<p>From Fort O&#8217;Call, an abandoned post of the Hudson&#8217;s
Bay Company on the Peace River, nearly the whole
tribe of the Athabasca Indians in possession of the
post now had come up the river, with their chief, Knife-in-the-Wind,
to meet the mikonaree. Factors of the
Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company, <i>coureurs de bois</i>, and <i>voyageurs</i>
had come among them at times, and once the renowned
Father Lacombe, the Jesuit priest, had stayed with them
three months; but never to this day had they seen a
Protestant mikonaree, though once a factor, noted for
his furious temper, his powers of running, and his
generosity, had preached to them. These men, however,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
were both over fifty years old. The Athabascas
did not hunger for the Christian religion, but a courier
from Edmonton had brought them word that a mikonaree
was coming to their country to stay, and they put
off their stoical manner and allowed themselves the luxury
of curiosity. That was why even the squaws and
papooses came up the river with the braves, all wondering
if the stranger had brought gifts with him, all eager
for their shares; for it had been said by the courier of
the tribe that &#8220;Oshondonto,&#8221; their name for the newcomer,
was bringing mysterious loads of well-wrapped
bales and skins. Upon a point below the first rapids
of the Little Manitou they waited with their camp-fires
burning and their pipe of peace.</p>
<p>When the canoes bearing Oshondonto and his <i>voyageurs</i>
shot the rapids to the song of the river,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style=' font-style:italic;margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;En roulant, ma boule roulant, </p>
<p  style=' font-style:italic;margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>En roulant, ma boule!&#8221; </p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>with the shrill voices of the boatmen rising to meet the
cry of the startled water-fowl, the Athabascas crowded
to the high banks. They grunted &#8220;How!&#8221; in greeting,
as the foremost canoe made for the shore.</p>
<p>But if surprise could have changed the countenances
of Indians, these Athabascas would not have known
one another when the missionary stepped out upon the
shore. They had looked to see a gray-bearded man
like the chief factor who quarrelled and prayed; but
they found instead a round-faced, clean-shaven youth,
with big, good-natured eyes, yellow hair, and a roundness
of body like that of a month-old bear&#8217;s cub. They
expected to find a man who, like the factor, could speak
their language, and they found a cherub sort of youth
who talked only English, French, and Chinook&mdash;that
common language of the North&mdash;and a few words of
their own language which he had learned on the way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>Besides, Oshondonto was so absent-minded at the
moment, so absorbed in admiration of the garish scene
before him, that he addressed the chief in French, of
which Knife-in-the-Wind knew but one word, <i>câche</i>,
which all the North knows.</p>
<p>But presently William Rufus Holly recovered himself,
and in stumbling Chinook made himself understood.
Opening a bale, he brought out beads and tobacco and
some bright red flannel, and two hundred Indians sat
round him and grunted &#8220;How!&#8221; and received his gifts
with little comment. Then the pipe of peace went
round, and Oshondonto smoked it becomingly.</p>
<p>But he saw that the Indians despised him for his
youth, his fatness, his yellow hair as soft as a girl&#8217;s, his
cherub face, browned though it was by the sun and
weather.</p>
<p>As he handed the pipe to Knife-in-the-Wind, an
Indian called Silver Tassel, with a cruel face, said, grimly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does Oshondonto travel to us?&#8221;</p>
<p>William Rufus Holly&#8217;s eyes steadied on those of the
Indian as he replied in Chinook: &#8220;To teach the way
to Manitou the Mighty, to tell the Athabascas of the
Great Chief who died to save the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The story is told in many ways; which is right?
There was the factor, Word of Thunder. There is the
song they sing at Edmonton&mdash;I have heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Great Chief is the same Chief,&#8221; answered the
missionary. &#8220;If you tell of Fort O&#8217;Call, and Knife-in-the-Wind
tells of Fort O&#8217;Call, he and you will speak
different words, and one will put in one thing and one
will leave out another; men&#8217;s tongues are different.
But Fort O&#8217;Call is the same, and the Great Chief is the
same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a long time ago,&#8221; said Knife-in-the-Wind,
sourly, &#8220;many thousand moon, as the pebbles in the
river, the years.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is the same world, and it is the same Chief, and
it was to save us,&#8221; answered William Rufus Holly,
smiling, yet with a fluttering heart, for the first test of
his life had come.</p>
<p>In anger Knife-in-the-Wind thrust an arrow into the
ground and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;How can the white man who died thousands of
moons ago in a far country save the red man of to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A strong man should bear so weak a tale,&#8221; broke
in Silver Tassel, ruthlessly. &#8220;Are we children, that the
Great Chief sends a child as messenger?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Billy Rufus did not know how to
reply, and in the pause Knife-in-the-Wind broke in two
pieces the arrow he had thrust in the ground in token of
displeasure.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as Oshondonto was about to speak, Silver
Tassel sprang to his feet, seized in his arms a lad of
twelve who was standing near, and, running to the bank,
dropped him into the swift current.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Oshondonto be not a child, let him save the
lad,&#8221; said Silver Tassel, standing on the brink.</p>
<p>Instantly William Rufus Holly was on his feet. His
coat was off before Silver Tassel&#8217;s words were out of
his mouth, and, crying, &#8220;In the name of the Great
White Chief!&#8221; he jumped into the rushing current.
&#8220;In the name of your Manitou, come on, Silver Tassel!&#8221;
he called up from the water, and struck out for the lad.</p>
<p>Not pausing an instant, Silver Tassel sprang into the
flood, into the whirling eddies and dangerous current
below the first rapids and above the second.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>II</p>
</div>

<p>Then came the struggle for Wingo of the Cree tribe,
a waif among the Athabascas, whose father had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
slain as they travelled, by a wandering tribe of Blackfeet.
Never was there a braver rivalry, although the odds were
with the Indian&mdash;in lightness, in brutal strength. With
the mikonaree, however, were skill, and that sort of
strength which the world calls &#8220;moral,&#8221; the strength of a
good and desperate purpose. Oshondonto knew that on
the issue of this shameless business&mdash;this cruel sport of
Silver Tassel&mdash;would depend his future on the Peace
River. As he shot forward with strong strokes in the
whirling torrent after the helpless lad, who, only able
to keep himself afloat, was being swept down toward
the rapids below, he glanced up to the bank along which
the Athabascas were running. He saw the garish
colors of their dresses; he saw the ignorant medicine-man,
with his mysterious bag, making incantations,
he saw the <i>tepee</i> of the chief, with its barbarous pennant
above; he saw the idle, naked children tearing at the
entrails of a calf; and he realized that this was a deadly
tournament between civilization and barbarism.</p>
<p>Silver Tassel was gaining on him; they were both
overhauling the boy; it was now to see which should
reach Wingo first, which should take him to shore.
That is, if both were not carried under before they
reached him; that is, if, having reached him, they and
he would ever get to shore; for, lower down, before it
reached the rapids, the current ran horribly smooth and
strong, and here and there were jagged rocks just
beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Still Silver Tassel gained on him, as they both gained
on the boy. Oshondonto swam strong and hard, but
he swam with his eyes on the struggle for the shore also;
he was not putting forth his utmost strength, for he
knew it would be bitterly needed, perhaps to save his
own life by a last effort.</p>
<p>Silver Tassel passed him when they were about fifty
feet from the boy. Shooting by on his side, with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
long stroke and a plunge of his body like a projectile,
the dark face with the long, black hair plastering it
turned toward his own, in fierce triumph Silver Tassel
cried &#8220;How!&#8221; in derision.</p>
<p>Billy Rufus set his teeth and lay down to his work
like a sportsman. His face had lost its roses, and it
was set and determined, but there was no look of fear
upon it, nor did his heart sink when a cry of triumph
went up from the crowd on the banks. The white man
knew by old experience in the cricket-field and in many
a boat-race that it is well not to halloo till you are out
of the woods. His mettle was up, he was not the
Reverend William Rufus Holly, missionary, but Billy
Rufus, the champion cricketer, the sportsman playing
a long game.</p>
<p>Silver Tassel reached the boy, who was bruised and
bleeding and at his last gasp, and, throwing an arm
round him, struck out for the shore. The current was
very strong, and he battled fiercely as Billy Rufus, not
far above, moved down toward them at an angle. For
a few yards Silver Tassel was going strong, then his
pace slackened, he seemed to sink lower in the water,
and his stroke became splashing and irregular. Suddenly
he struck a rock, which bruised him badly, and,
swerving from his course, he lost his stroke and let go
the boy.</p>
<p>By this time the mikonaree had swept beyond them,
and he caught the boy by his long hair as he was being
swept below. Striking out for the shore, he swam with
bold, strong strokes, his judgment guiding him well past
rocks beneath the surface. Ten feet from shore he
heard a cry of alarm from above. It concerned Silver
Tassel, he knew, but he could not look round yet.</p>
<p>In another moment the boy was dragged up the bank
by strong hands, and Billy Rufus swung round in the
water toward Silver Tassel, who, in his confused energy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
had struck another rock, and, exhausted now, was being
swept toward the rapids. Silver Tassel&#8217;s shoulder
scarcely showed&mdash;his strength was gone. In a flash
Billy Rufus saw there was but one thing to do. He
must run the rapids with Silver Tassel&mdash;there was no
other way. It would be a fight through the jaws of
death; but no Indian&#8217;s eyes had a better sense for river-life
than William Rufus Holly&#8217;s.</p>
<p>How he reached Silver Tassel, and drew the Indian&#8217;s
arm over his own shoulder; how they drove down into
the boiling flood; how Billy Rufus&#8217; fat body was battered
and torn and ran red with blood from twenty
flesh wounds; but how by luck beyond the telling he
brought Silver Tassel through safely into the quiet
water a quarter of a mile below the rapids, and was
hauled out, both more dead than alive, is a tale still
told by the Athabascas around their camp-fire. The
rapids are known to-day as the Mikonaree Rapids.</p>
<p>The end of this beginning of the young man&#8217;s career
was that Silver Tassel gave him the word of eternal
friendship, Knife-in-the-Wind took him into the tribe, and
the boy Wingo became his very own, to share his home
and his travels, no longer a waif among the Athabascas.</p>
<p>After three days&#8217; feasting, at the end of which the
missionary held his first service and preached his first
sermon, to the accompaniment of grunts of satisfaction
from the whole tribe of Athabascas, William Rufus
Holly began his work in the Far North.</p>
<p>The journey to Fort O&#8217;Call was a procession of
triumph, for, as it was summer, there was plenty of
food, the missionary had been a success, and he had
distributed many gifts of beads and flannel.</p>
<p>All went well for many moons, although converts
were uncertain and baptisms few, and the work was
hard and the loneliness at times terrible. But at last
came dark days.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>One summer and autumn there had been poor fishing
and shooting, the <i>câches</i> of meat were fewer on the
plains, and almost nothing had come up to Fort O&#8217;Call
from Edmonton, far below. The yearly supplies for
the missionary, paid for out of his private income&mdash;the
bacon, beans, tea, coffee, and flour&mdash;had been raided by
a band of hostile Indians, and he viewed with deep
concern the progress of the severe winter. Although
three years of hard, frugal life had made his muscles
like iron, they had only mellowed his temper, increased
his flesh, and rounded his face; nor did he look an hour
older than on the day when he had won Wingo for his
willing slave and devoted friend.</p>
<p>He never resented the frequent ingratitude of the
Indians; he said little when they quarrelled over the
small comforts his little income brought them yearly
from the South. He had been doctor, lawyer, judge
among them, although he interfered little in the larger
disputes, and was forced to shut his eyes to intertribal
enmities. He had no deep faith that he could quite
civilize them; he knew that their conversion was only
on the surface, and he fell back on his personal influence
with them. By this he could check even the excesses
of the worst man in the tribe, his old enemy, Silver
Tassel of the bad heart, who yet was ready always to
give a tooth for a tooth, and accepted the fact that he
owed Oshondonto his life.</p>
<p>When famine crawled across the plains to the doors
of the settlement and housed itself at Fort O&#8217;Call, Silver
Tassel acted badly, however, and sowed fault-finding
among the thoughtless of the tribe.</p>
<p>&#8220;What manner of Great Spirit is it who lets the food
of his chief Oshondonto fall into the hands of the Blackfeet?&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Oshondonto says the Great Spirit
hears. What has the Great Spirit to say? Let Oshondonto
ask.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>Again, when they were all hungrier, he went among
them with complaining words. &#8220;If the white man&#8217;s
Great Spirit can do all things, let him give Oshondonto
and the Athabascas food.&#8221;</p>
<p>The missionary did not know of Silver Tassel&#8217;s foolish
words, but he saw the downcast face of Knife-in-the-Wind,
the sullen looks of the people; and he unpacked
the box he had reserved jealously for the darkest days
that might come. For meal after meal he divided these
delicacies among them&mdash;morsels of biscuit, and tinned
meats, and dried fruits. But his eyes meanwhile were
turned again and again to the storm raging without, as
it had raged for this the longest week he had ever spent.
If it would but slacken, a boat could go out to the nets
set in the lake near by some days before, when the sun
of spring had melted the ice. From the hour the nets
had been set the storm had raged. On the day when
the last morsel of meat and biscuit had been given away
the storm had not abated, and he saw with misgiving
the gloomy, stolid faces of the Indians round him.
One man, two children, and three women had died in
a fortnight. He dreaded to think what might happen,
his heart ached at the looks of gaunt suffering in the
faces of all; he saw, for the first time, how black and
bitter Knife-in-the-Wind looked as Silver Tassel whispered
to him.</p>
<p>With the color all gone from his cheeks, he left the
post and made his way to the edge of the lake where
his canoe was kept. Making it ready for the launch, he
came back to the fort. Assembling the Indians, who
had watched his movements closely, he told them that
he was going through the storm to the nets on the lake,
and asked for a volunteer to go with him.</p>
<p>No one replied. He pleaded&mdash;for the sake of the
women and children.</p>
<p>Then Knife-in-the-Wind spoke. &#8220;Oshondonto will die
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
if he goes. It is a fool&#8217;s journey&mdash;does the wolverine
walk into an empty trap?&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy Rufus spoke passionately now. His genial spirit
fled; he reproached them.</p>
<p>Silver Tassel spoke up loudly: &#8220;Let Oshondonto&#8217;s
Great Spirit carry him to the nets alone, and back again
with fish for the heathen the Great Chief died to save.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a wicked heart, Silver Tassel. You know
well that one man can&#8217;t handle the boat and the nets
also. Is there no one of you&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>A figure shot forward from a corner. &#8220;I will go with
Oshondonto,&#8221; came the voice of Wingo, the waif of the
Crees.</p>
<p>The eye of the mikonaree flashed round in contempt
on the tribe. Then suddenly it softened, and he said
to the lad, &#8220;We will go together, Wingo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking the boy by the hand, he ran with him through
the rough wind to the shore, launched the canoe on the
tossing lake, and paddled away through the tempest.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The bitter winds of an angry spring, the sleet and
wet snow of a belated winter, the floating blocks of ice
crushing against the side of the boat, the black water
swishing over man and boy, the harsh, inclement world
near and far.... The passage made at last to the nets;
the brave Wingo steadying the canoe&mdash;a skilful hand
sufficing where the strength of a Samson would not have
availed; the nets half full, and the breaking cry of joy
from the lips of the waif&mdash;a cry that pierced the storm
and brought back an answering cry from the crowd of
Indians on the far shore.... The quarter-hour of danger
in the tossing canoe; the nets too heavy to be dragged,
and fastened to the thwarts instead; the canoe going
shoreward jerkily, a cork on the waves with an anchor
behind; heavier seas and winds roaring down on them
as they slowly near the shore; and at last, in one awful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
moment, the canoe upset, and the man and the boy in
the water.... Then both clinging to the upturned
canoe as it is driven near and nearer shore.... The
boy washed off once, twice, and the man with his arm
round clinging&mdash;clinging, as the shrieking storm answers
to the calling of the Athabascas on the shore, and
drives craft and fish and man and boy down upon the
banks; no savage bold enough to plunge in to their
rescue.... At last a rope thrown, a drowning man&#8217;s
wrists wound round it, his teeth set in it&mdash;and now, at
last, a man and a heathen boy, both insensible, being
carried to the mikonaree&#8217;s hut and laid upon two beds,
one on either side of the small room, as the red sun
goes slowly down.... The two still bodies on bearskins
in the hut, and a hundred superstitious Indians
flying from the face of death.... The two alone in the
light of the flickering fire; the many gone to feast on
fish, the price of lives.</p>
<p>But the price was not yet paid, for the man waked
from insensibility&mdash;waked to see himself with the body
of the boy beside him in the red light of the fires.</p>
<p>For a moment his heart stopped beating, he turned
sick and faint. Deserted by those for whom he risked
his life!... How long had he lain there? What time
was it? When was it that he had fought his way to
the nets and back again&mdash;hours, maybe? And the
dead boy there, Wingo, who had risked his life, also
dead&mdash;how long? His heart leaped&mdash;ah, not hours,
only minutes, maybe. It was sundown as unconsciousness
came on him&mdash;Indians would not stay with the
dead after sundown. Maybe it was only ten minutes&mdash;five
minutes&mdash;one minute ago since they left him!...</p>
<p>His watch! Shaking fingers drew it out, wild eyes
scanned it. It was not stopped. Then it could have
only been minutes ago. Trembling to his feet, he
staggered over to Wingo, he felt the body, he held a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
mirror to the lips. Yes, surely there was light moisture
on the glass.</p>
<p>Then began another fight with death&mdash;William Rufus
Holly struggling to bring to life again Wingo, the waif of
of the Crees.</p>
<p>The blood came back to his own heart with a rush as
the mad desire to save this life came on him. He
talked to the dumb face, he prayed in a kind of delirium,
as he moved the arms up and down, as he tilted the
body, as he rubbed, chafed, and strove. He forgot he
was a missionary, he almost cursed himself. &#8220;For
them&mdash;for cowards, I risked his life, the brave lad
with no home! Oh, God! give him back to me!&#8221; he
sobbed. &#8220;What right had I to risk his life for theirs?
I should have shot the first man that refused to go....
Wingo, speak! Wake up! Come back!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sweat poured from him in his desperation and
weakness. He said to himself that he had put this
young life into the hazard without cause. Had he, then,
saved the lad from the rapids and Silver Tassel&#8217;s brutality
only to have him drag fish out of the jaws of death
for Silver Tassel&#8217;s meal?</p>
<p>It seemed to him that he had been working for hours,
though it was in fact only a short time, when the eyes
of the lad slowly opened and closed again, and he
began to breathe spasmodically. A cry of joy came
from the lips of the missionary, and he worked harder
still. At last the eyes opened wide, stayed open, saw
the figure bent over him, and the lips whispered, &#8220;Oshondonto&mdash;my
master!&#8221; as a cup of brandy was held to his
lips.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Billy Rufus the cricketer had won the game, and
somehow the Reverend William Rufus Holly the
missionary never repented the strong language he
used against the Athabascas as he was bringing Wingo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
back to life, though it was not what is called &#8220;strictly
canonical.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had conquered the Athabascas forever. Even
Silver Tassel acknowledged his power, and he as industriously
spread abroad the report that the mikonaree
had raised Wingo from the dead, as he had sown dissension
during the famine. But the result was that
the missionary had power in the land, and the belief
in him was so great that, when Knife-in-the-Wind died,
the tribe came to him to raise their chief from the
dead. They never quite believed that he could not&mdash;not
even Silver Tassel, who now rules the Athabascas
and is ruled in turn by William Rufus Holly: which
is a very good thing for the Athabascas.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
<h2>THE HEALING SPRINGS AND THE PIONEERS</h2>
</div>

<p>He came out of the mysterious South one summer
day, driving before him a few sheep, a cow, and a long-eared
mule which carried his tent and other necessaries,
and camped outside the town on a knoll, at the base
of which was a thicket of close shrub. During the
first day no one in Jansen thought anything of it, for it
was a land of pilgrimage, and hundreds came and went on
their journeys in search of free homesteads and good
water and pasturage. But when, after three days, he
was still there, Nicolle Terasse, who had little to do and
an insatiable curiosity, went out to see him. He found
a new sensation for Jansen. This is what he said when
he came back:</p>
<p>&#8220;You want know &#8217;bout him, <i>bagosh</i>! Dat is somet&#8217;ing
to see, dat man&mdash;Ingles is his name. Sooch hair&mdash;mooch
long an&#8217; brown, and a leetla beard not so
brown, an&#8217; a leather sole onto his feet, and a gray coat
to his ankles&mdash;<i>oui</i>, so like dat. An&#8217; his voice&mdash;<i>voilà</i>,
it is like water in a cave. He is a great man&mdash;I dunno
not; but he spik at me like dis, &#8216;Is dere sick, and cripple,
and stay-in-bed people here dat can&#8217;t get up?&#8217; he say.
An&#8217; I say, &#8216;Not plenty, but some&mdash;<i>bagosh</i>! Dere is dat
Miss Greet, an&#8217; ole Ma&#8217;am Drouchy, an&#8217; dat young
Pete Hayes&mdash;an&#8217; so on.&#8217; &#8216;Well, if they have faith I
will heal them,&#8217; he spik at me. &#8216;From de Healing
Springs dey shall rise to walk,&#8217; he say. <i>Bagosh</i>, you not
t&#8217;ink dat true? Den you go see.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>So Jansen turned out to see, and besides the man
they found a curious thing. At the foot of the knoll, in
a space which he had cleared, was a hot spring that
bubbled and rose and sank, and drained away into the
thirsty ground. Luck had been with Ingles the Faith
Healer. Whether he knew of the existence of this
spring, or whether he chanced upon it, he did not say;
but while he held Jansen in the palm of his hand, in
the feverish days that followed, there were many who
attached mysterious significance to it, who claimed for it
supernatural origin. In any case, the one man who had
known of the existence of this spring was far away from
Jansen, and he did not return till a day of reckoning
came for the Faith Healer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jansen made pilgrimage to the Springs
of Healing, and at unexpected times Ingles suddenly
appeared in the town, and stood at street corners; and
in his &#8220;Patmian voice,&#8221; as Flood Rawley the lawyer
called it, warned the people to flee their sins, and, purifying
their hearts, learn to cure all ills of mind and
body, the weaknesses of the sinful flesh and the &#8220;ancient
evil&#8221; in their souls, by faith that saves.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Is not the life more than meat?</i>&#8217;&#8221; he asked them.
&#8220;And if, peradventure, there be those among you who
have true belief in hearts all purged of evil, and yet are
maimed, or sick of body, come to me, and I will lay my
hands upon you, and I will heal you.&#8221; Thus he cried.</p>
<p>There were those so wrought upon by his strange
eloquence and spiritual passion, so hypnotized by his
physical and mental exaltation, that they rose up from
the hand-laying and the prayer eased of their ailments.
Others he called upon to lie in the hot spring at the foot
of the hill for varying periods, before the laying-on of
hands, and these also, crippled or rigid with troubles of
the bone, announced that they were healed.</p>
<p>People flocked from other towns, and though, to some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
who had been cured, their pains and sickness returned,
there were a few who bore perfect evidence to his teaching
and healing, and followed him, &#8220;converted and consecrated,&#8221;
as though he were a new Messiah. In this
corner of the West was such a revival as none could
remember&mdash;not even those who had been to camp-meetings
in the East in their youth, and had seen the
Spirit descend upon hundreds and draw them to the
anxious seat.</p>
<p>Then came the great sensation&mdash;the Faith Healer
converted Laura Sloly. Upon which Jansen drew its
breath painfully; for, while it was willing to bend to the
inspiration of the moment, and to be swept on a tide of
excitement into that enchanted field called Imagination,
it wanted to preserve its institutions&mdash;and Laura Sloly
had come to be an institution. Jansen had always
plumed itself, and smiled, when she passed; and even
now the most sentimentally religious of them inwardly
anticipated the time when the town would return to its
normal condition; and that condition would not be
normal if there were any change in Laura Sloly. It
mattered little whether most people were changed or
not, because one state of their minds could not be less
or more interesting than another; but a change in Laura
Sloly could not be for the better.</p>
<p>Her father had come to the West in the early days,
and had prospered by degrees until a town grew up
beside his ranch; and though he did not acquire as
much permanent wealth from this golden chance as
might have been expected, and lost much he did make
by speculation, still he had his rich ranch left, and it
and he and Laura were part of the history of Jansen.
Laura had been born at Jansen before even it had
a name. Next to her father she was the oldest inhabitant,
and she had a prestige which was given to no
one else.</p>

THE FAITH HEALER<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>Everything had conspired to make her a figure of
moment and interest. She was handsome in almost a
mannish sort of way, being of such height and straightness,
and her brown eyes had a depth and fire in which
more than a few men had drowned themselves. Also,
once she had saved a settlement by riding ahead of a
marauding Indian band to warn their intended victims,
and had averted another tragedy of pioneer life.
Pioneers proudly told strangers to Jansen of the girl
of thirteen who rode a hundred and twenty miles
without food, and sank inside the palisade of the Hudson
Bay Company&#8217;s fort, as the gates closed upon
the settlers taking refuge, the victim of brain fever at
last. <i>Cerebro-spinal meningitis</i>, the doctor from Winnipeg
called it, and the memory of that time when men
and women would not sleep till her crisis was past was
still fresh on the tongues of all.</p>
<p>Then she had married at seventeen, and, within a
year, had lost both her husband and her baby, a child
bereaved of her Playmates&mdash;for her husband had been
but twenty years old and was younger far than she in
everything. And since then, twelve years before, she
had seen generations of lovers pass into the land they
thought delectable; and their children flocked to her,
hung about her, were carried off by her to the ranch,
and kept for days, against the laughing protests of their
parents. Flood Rawley called her the Pied Piper of
Jansen, and, indeed, she had a voice that fluted and
piped, and yet had so whimsical a note that the hardest
faces softened at the sound of it; and she did not keep
its best notes for the few. She was impartial, almost
impersonal; no woman was her enemy, and every man
was her friend&mdash;and nothing more. She had never
had an accepted lover since the day her Playmates left
her. Every man except one had given up hope that
he might win her; and though he had been gone from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Jansen for two years, and had loved her since the days
before the Playmates came and went, he never gave
up hope, and was now to return and say again what he
had mutely said for years&mdash;what she understood, and
he knew she understood.</p>
<p>Tim Denton had been a wild sort in his brief day.
He was a rough diamond, but he was a diamond, and
was typical of the West&mdash;its heart, its courage, its
freedom, and its force; capable of exquisite gentleness
strenuous to exaggeration, with a very primitive religion,
and the only religion Tim knew was that of human
nature. Jansen did not think Tim good enough&mdash;not
within a comet shot&mdash;for Laura Sloly; but they thought
him better than any one else.</p>
<p>But now Laura was a convert to the prophet of the
Healing Springs, and those people who still retained
their heads in the eddy of religious emotion were in
despair. They dreaded to meet Laura; they kept away
from the &#8220;protracted meetings,&#8221; but were eager to hear
about her and what she said and did. What they heard
allayed their worst fears. She still smiled, and seemed
as cheerful as before, they heard, and she neither spoke
nor prayed in public, but she led the singing always.
Now the anxious and the sceptical and the reactionary
ventured out to see and hear; and seeing and hearing
gave them a satisfaction they hardly dared express.
She was more handsome than ever, and if her eyes
glistened with a light they had never seen before, and
awed them, her lips still smiled, and the old laugh came
when she spoke to them. Their awe increased. This
was &#8220;getting religion&#8221; with a difference.</p>
<p>But presently they received a shock. A whisper
grew that Laura was in love with the Faith Healer.
Some woman&#8217;s instinct drove straight to the centre of
a disconcerting possibility, and in consternation she
told her husband; and Jansen husbands had a freemasonry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
of gossip. An hour, and all Jansen knew, or
thought they knew; and the &#8220;saved&#8221; rejoiced; and
the rest of the population, represented by Nicolle
Terasse at one end and Flood Rawley at the other,
flew to arms. No vigilance committee was ever more
determined and secret and organized than the unconverted
civic patriots who were determined to restore
Jansen to its old-time condition. They pointed out
cold-bloodedly that the Faith Healer had failed three
times where he had succeeded once; and that, admitting
the successes, there was no proof that his religion
was their cause. There were such things as hypnotism
and magnetism and will-power, and abnormal mental
stimulus on the part of the healed&mdash;to say nothing of
the Healing Springs.</p>
<p>Carefully laying their plans, they quietly spread the
rumor that Ingles had promised to restore to health
old Mary Jewell, who had been bedridden ten years,
and had sent word and prayed to have him lay his
hands upon her&mdash;Catholic though she was. The Faith
Healer, face to face with this supreme and definite test,
would have retreated from it but for Laura Sloly. She
expected him to do it, believed that he could, said that
he would, herself arranged the day and the hour, and
sang so much exaltation into him that at last a spurious
power seemed to possess him. He felt that there had
entered into him something that could be depended on,
not the mere flow of natural magnetism fed by an
out-door life and a temperament of great emotional
force and chance and suggestion&mdash;and other things.
If, at first, he had influenced Laura, some ill-controlled,
latent idealism in him, working on a latent poetry and
spirituality in her, somehow bringing her into nearer
touch with her lost Playmates than she had been in the
long years that had passed; she, in turn, had made his
unrationalized brain reel; had caught him up into a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
higher air, on no wings of his own; had added another
lover to her company of lovers&mdash;and the first impostor
she had ever had. She who had known only honest
men as friends, in one blind moment lost her perspicuous
sense; her instinct seemed asleep. She believed
in the man and in his healing. Was there anything
more than that?</p>
<p>The day of the great test came, hot, brilliant, vivid.
The air was of a delicate sharpness, and, as it came
toward evening, the glamour of an August when the
reapers reap was upon Jansen; and its people gathered
round the house of Mary Jewell to await the miracle of
faith. Apart from the emotional many who sang hymns
and spiritual songs were a few determined men, bent on
doing justice to Jansen though the heavens might fall.
Whether or no Laura Sloly was in love with the Faith
Healer, Jansen must look to its own honor&mdash;and hers.
In any case, this peripatetic saint at Sloly&#8217;s Ranch&mdash;the
idea was intolerable; women must be saved in spite
of themselves.</p>
<p>Laura was now in the house by the side of the bedridden
Mary Jewell, waiting, confident, smiling, as she
held the wasted hand on the coverlet. With her was a
minister of the Baptist persuasion, who was swimming
with the tide, and who approved of the Faith Healer&#8217;s
immersions in the hot Healing Springs; also a medical
student who had pretended belief in Ingles, and two
women weeping with unnecessary remorse for human
failings of no dire kind. The windows were open, and
those outside could see. Presently, in a lull of the
singing, there was a stir in the crowd, and then sudden
loud greetings&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;My, if it ain&#8217;t Tim Denton! Jerusalem! You
back, Tim!&#8221;</p>
<p>These and other phrases caught the ear of Laura
Sloly in the sick-room. A strange look flashed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
across her face, and the depth of her eyes was troubled
for a moment, as to the face of the old comes a tremor
at the note of some long-forgotten song. Then she
steadied herself and waited, catching bits of the loud
talk which still floated toward her from without.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up? Some one getting married&mdash;or a legacy,
or a saw-off? Why, what a lot of Sunday-go-to-meeting
folks <i>to</i> be sure!&#8221; Tim laughed loudly.</p>
<p>After which the quick tongue of Nicolle Terasse:
&#8220;You want know? <i>Tiens</i>, be quiet; here he come. He
cure you body and soul, ver&#8217; queeck&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd swayed and parted, and slowly, bare head
uplifted, face looking to neither right nor left, the Faith
Healer made his way to the door of the little house.
The crowd hushed. Some were awed, some were
overpoweringly interested, some were cruelly patient.
Nicolle Terasse and others were whispering loudly to Tim
Denton. That was the only sound, until the Healer got to
the door. Then, on the steps, he turned to the multitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peace be to you all, and upon this house,&#8221; he said,
and stepped through the doorway.</p>
<p>Tim Denton, who had been staring at the face of
the Healer, stood for an instant like one with all his
senses arrested. Then he gasped and exclaimed, &#8220;Well,
I&#8217;m eternally&mdash;!&#8221; and broke off with a low laugh, which
was at first mirthful, and then became ominous and hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, magnificent!&mdash;magnificent!&mdash;jerickety!&#8221; he said
into the sky above him.</p>
<p>His friends who were not &#8220;saved&#8221; closed in on him
to find the meaning of his words, but he pulled himself
together, looked blankly at them, and asked them
questions. They told him so much more than he cared
to hear that his face flushed a deep red&mdash;the bronze of
it most like the color of Laura Sloly&#8217;s hair; then he turned
pale. Men saw that he was roused beyond any feeling
in themselves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sh!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see what he can do.&#8221; With
the many who were silently praying, as they had been
bidden to do, the invincible ones leaned forward, watching
the little room where healing&mdash;or tragedy&mdash;was
afoot. As in a picture, framed by the window, they
saw the kneeling figures, the Healer standing with outstretched
arms. They heard his voice, sonorous and
appealing, then commanding&mdash;and yet Mary Jewell did
not rise from her bed and walk. Again, and yet again,
the voice rang out, and still the woman lay motionless.
Then he laid his hands upon her, and again he commanded
her to rise.</p>
<p>There was a faint movement, a desperate struggle to
obey, but Nature and Time and Disease had their way.</p>
<p>Yet again there was the call. An agony stirred the
bed. Then another great Healer came between and
mercifully dealt the sufferer a blow&mdash;Death has a gentle
hand sometimes. Mary Jewell was bedridden still&mdash;and
forever.</p>
<p>Like a wind from the mountains the chill knowledge
of death wailed through the window and over the heads
of the crowd. All the figures were upright now in the
little room. Then those outside saw Laura Sloly lean
over and close the sightless eyes. This done, she came
to the door and opened it, and motioned for the Healer
to leave. He hesitated, hearing the harsh murmur from
the outskirts of the crowd. Once again she motioned,
and he came. With a face deadly pale she surveyed
the people before her silently for a moment, her eyes all
huge and staring. Presently she turned to Ingles and
spoke to him quickly in a low voice; then, descending
the steps, passed out through the lane made for her by
the crowd, he following with shaking limbs and bowed
head.</p>
<p>Warning words had passed among the few invincible
ones who waited where the Healer must pass into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
open, and there was absolute stillness as Laura advanced.
Their work was to come&mdash;quiet and swift and sure;
but not yet.</p>
<p>Only one face Laura saw as she led the way to the
moment&#8217;s safety&mdash;Tim Denton&#8217;s; and it was as stricken
as her own. She passed, then turned and looked at him
again. He understood; she wanted him.</p>
<p>He waited till she sprang into her wagon, after the
Healer had mounted his mule and ridden away with
ever-quickening pace into the prairie. Then he turned
to the set, fierce men beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave him alone,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;leave him to me. I
know him. You hear? Ain&#8217;t I no rights? I tell you
I knew him&mdash;South. You leave him to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>They nodded, and he sprang into his saddle and rode
away. They watched the figure of the Healer growing
smaller in the dusty distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim&#8217;ll go to her,&#8221; one said, &#8220;and perhaps they&#8217;ll let
the snake get off. Hadn&#8217;t we best make sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;d better let him vamoose,&#8221; said Flood
Rawley, anxiously. &#8220;Jansen is a law-abiding place.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply was decisive. Jansen had its honor to keep.
It was the home of the Pioneers&mdash;Laura Sloly was a
Pioneer.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Tim Denton was a Pioneer, with all the comradeship
which lay in the word, and he was that sort of lover
who has seen one woman and can never see another&mdash;not
the product of the most modern civilization. Before
Laura had had Playmates he had given all he had to
give; he had waited and hoped ever since; and when
the ruthless gossips had said to him before Mary Jewell&#8217;s
house that she was in love with the Faith Healer,
nothing changed in him. For the man&mdash;for Ingles&mdash;Tim
belonged to a primitive breed, and love was not in his
heart. As he rode out to Sloly&#8217;s Ranch, he ground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
his teeth in rage. But Laura had called him to her,
and&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what you say goes, Laura,&#8221; he muttered at
the end of a long hour of human passion and its repression.
&#8220;If he&#8217;s to go scot-free, then he&#8217;s got to go;
but the boys yonder&#8217;ll drop on me if he gets away.
Can&#8217;t you see what a swab he is, Laura?&#8221;</p>
<p>The brown eyes of the girl looked at him gently.
The struggle between them was over; she had had her
way&mdash;to save the preacher, impostor though he was;
and now she felt, as she had never felt before in the same
fashion, that this man was a man of men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim, you do not understand,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;You say
he was a landsharp in the South, and that he had to
leave&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had to vamoose, or take tar and feathers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he had to leave. And he came here preaching
and healing; and he is a hypocrite and a fraud&mdash;I
know that now, my eyes are opened. He didn&#8217;t do
what he said he could do, and it killed Mary Jewell&mdash;the
shock; and there were other things he said he could
do, and didn&#8217;t do them. Perhaps he is all bad, as you
say&mdash;I don&#8217;t think so. But he did some good things,
and through him I&#8217;ve felt as I&#8217;ve never felt before about
God and life, and about Walt and the baby&mdash;as though
I&#8217;ll see them again, sure. I&#8217;ve never felt that before.
It was all as if they were lost in the hills, and no trail
home, or out to where they are. Like as not God was
working in him all the time, Tim; and he failed because
he counted too much on the little he had, and made
up for what he hadn&#8217;t by what he pretended.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can pretend to himself, or God Almighty, or
that lot down there&#8221;&mdash;he jerked a finger toward the
town&mdash;&#8220;but to you, a girl, and a Pioneer&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A flash of humor shot into her eyes at his last words,
then they filled with tears, through which the smile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
shone. To pretend to &#8220;a Pioneer&#8221;&mdash;the splendid vanity
and egotism of the West!</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t pretend to me, Tim. People don&#8217;t usually
have to <i>pretend</i> to like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I&#8217;m driving at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I know. And whatever he is, you&#8217;ve said
that you will save him. I&#8217;m straight, you know that.
Somehow, what I felt from his preaching&mdash;well, everything
got sort of mixed up with him, and he was&mdash;was
different. It was like the long dream of Walt and
the baby, and he a part of it. I don&#8217;t know what I
felt, or what I might have felt for him. I&#8217;m a woman&mdash;I
can&#8217;t understand. But I know what I feel now. I
never want to see him again on earth&mdash;or in heaven.
It needn&#8217;t be necessary even in heaven; but what
happened between God and me through him stays,
Tim; and so you must help him get away safe. It&#8217;s in
your hands&mdash;you say they left it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t trust that too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly he pointed out of the window toward the
town. &#8220;See, I&#8217;m right; there they are, a dozen of &#8217;em
mounted. They&#8217;re off, to run him down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face paled; she glanced toward the Hill of Healing.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got an hour&#8217;s start,&#8221; she said; &#8220;he&#8217;ll get
into the mountains and be safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t catch him &#8217;fore that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or if you don&#8217;t get to him first,&#8221; she said, with
nervous insistence.</p>
<p>He turned to her with a hard look; then, as he met
her soft, fearless, beautiful eyes, his own grew gentle.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a lot of doing. Yet I&#8217;ll do it for you,
Laura,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s hard on the Pioneers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more her humor flashed, and it seemed to him
that &#8220;getting religion&#8221; was not so depressing after all&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
be, anyhow, when this nasty job was over.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pioneers will get over it, Tim,&#8221; she rejoined.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
&#8220;They&#8217;ve swallowed a lot in their time. Heaven&#8217;s gate
will have to be pretty wide to let in a real Pioneer,&#8221; she
added. &#8220;He takes up so much room&mdash;ah, Timothy
Denton!&#8221; she added, with an outburst of whimsical merriment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t spoiled you&mdash;being converted&mdash;has it?&#8221; he
said, and gave a quick little laugh, which somehow did
more for his ancient cause with her than all he had ever
said or done. Then he stepped outside and swung into
his saddle.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It had been a hard and anxious ride, but Tim had
won, and was keeping his promise. The night had
fallen before he got to the mountains, which he and the
Pioneers had seen the Faith Healer enter. They had
had four miles&#8217; start of Tim, and had ridden fiercely,
and they entered the gulch into which the refugee had
disappeared still two miles ahead.</p>
<p>The invincibles had seen Tim coming, but they had
determined to make a sure thing of it, and would themselves
do what was necessary with the impostor, and
take no chances. So they pressed their horses, and he
saw them swallowed by the trees as darkness gathered.
Changing his course, he entered the familiar hills, which
he knew better than any Pioneer of Jansen, and rode a
diagonal course over the trail they would take. But
night fell suddenly, and there was nothing to do but
to wait till morning. There was comfort in this&mdash;the
others must also wait, and the refugee could not go far.
In any case, he must make for settlement or perish,
since he had left behind his sheep and his cow.</p>
<p>It fell out better than Tim hoped. The Pioneers were
as good hunters as was he, their instinct was as sure,
their scouts and trackers were many, and he was but
one. They found the Faith Healer by a little stream,
eating bread and honey, and, like an ancient woodlander,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
drinking from a horn&mdash;relic of his rank imposture.
He made no resistance. They tried him, formally if
perfunctorily; he admitted his imposture, and begged
for his life. Then they stripped him naked, tied a bit of
canvas round his waist, fastened him to a tree, and were
about to complete his punishment when Tim Denton
burst upon them.</p>
<p>Whether the rage Tim showed was all real or not;
whether his accusations of bad faith came from so
deeply wounded a spirit as he would have them believe,
he was not likely to tell; but he claimed the prisoner
as his own, and declined to say what he meant to do.
When, however, they saw the abject terror of the Faith
Healer as he begged not to be left alone with Tim&mdash;for
they had not meant death, and Ingles thought he read
death in Tim&#8217;s ferocious eyes&mdash;they laughed cynically,
and left it to Tim to uphold the honor of Jansen and the
Pioneers.</p>
<p>As they disappeared, the last thing they saw was Tim
with his back to them, his hands on his hips, and a knife
clasped in his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll lift his scalp and make a monk of him,&#8221;
chuckled the oldest and hardest of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat Tim will cut his heart out, I t&#8217;ink&mdash;<i>bagosh</i>!&#8221;
said Nicolle Terasse, and took a drink of white whiskey.</p>
<p>For a long time Tim stood looking at the other, until
no sound came from the woods whither the Pioneers
had gone. Then at last, slowly and with no roughness,
as the terror-stricken impostor shrank and withered, he
cut the cords.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dress yourself,&#8221; he said, shortly, and sat down beside
the stream, and washed his face and hands as though to
cleanse them from contamination. He appeared to take
no notice of the other, though his ears keenly noted
every movement.</p>
<p>The impostor dressed nervously, yet slowly; he scarce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
comprehended anything, except that he was not in immediate
danger. When he had finished, he stood looking
at Tim, who was still seated on a log plunged in meditation.</p>
<p>It seemed hours before Tim turned round, and now
his face was quiet, if set and determined. He walked
slowly over, and stood looking at his victim for some
time without speaking. The other&#8217;s eyes dropped, and
a grayness stole over his features. This steely calm
was even more frightening than the ferocity which had
previously been in his captor&#8217;s face. At length the tense
silence was broken:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t the old game good enough? Was it played
out? Why did you take to this? Why did you do it,
Scranton?&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice quavered a little in reply: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.
Something sort of pushed me into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you come to start it?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long silence, then the husky reply came:</p>
<p>&#8220;I got a sickener last time&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember, at Waywing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got into the desert, and had hard times&mdash;awful for
a while. I hadn&#8217;t enough to eat, and I didn&#8217;t know
whether I&#8217;d die by hunger or fever or Indians&mdash;or
snakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you were seeing snakes!&#8221; said Tim, grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the kind you mean; I hadn&#8217;t anything to
drink&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you never did drink, I remember&mdash;just was
crooked, and slopped over women. Well, about the
snakes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I caught them to eat, and they were poison-snakes
often. And I wasn&#8217;t quick at first to get them safe by
the neck&mdash;they&#8217;re quick, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim laughed inwardly. &#8220;Getting your food by the
sweat of your brow&mdash;and a snake in it, same as Adam!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
Well, was it in the desert you got your taste for honey,
too, same as John the Baptist&mdash;that was his name, if I
recomember?&#8221; He looked at the tin of honey on the
ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the desert, but when I got to the grass-country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long were you in the desert?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Close to a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim&#8217;s eyes opened wider. He saw that the man was
speaking the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to thinking in the desert, and sort of willing
things to come to pass, and mooning along, you and
the sky and the vultures and the hot hills and the
snakes and the flowers&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There weren&#8217;t any flowers till I got to the grass-country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, cuss me, if you ain&#8217;t simple for your kind! I
know all about that. And when you got to the grass-country
you just picked up the honey and the flowers,
and a calf and a lamb and a mule here and there,
&#8216;without money and without price,&#8217; and walked on&mdash;that
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other shrank before the steel in the voice, and
nodded his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you kept thinking in the grass-country of what
you&#8217;d felt and said and done&mdash;and willed, in the desert,
I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the other nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed to you in the desert as if you&#8217;d saved
your own life a hundred times, as if you&#8217;d just willed
food and drink and safety to come; as if Providence had
been at your elbow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like a dream, and it stayed with me. I had
to think in the desert things I&#8217;d never thought before,&#8221;
was the half-abstracted answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>felt</i> good in the desert?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>The other hung his head in shame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes you seem pretty small, doesn&#8217;t it? You
didn&#8217;t stay long enough, I guess, to get what you were
feeling for; you started in on the new racket too soon.
You never got really possessed that you was a sinner.
I expect that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know much about such things. I was
loose brought up; but I&#8217;ve a friend&#8221;&mdash;Laura was before
his eyes&mdash;&#8220;that says religion&#8217;s all right, and long ago
as I can remember my mother used to pray three times
a day&mdash;with grace at meals, too. I know there&#8217;s a lot
in it for them that need it; and there seems to be a lot
of folks needing it, if I&#8217;m to judge by folks down there
at Jansen, &#8217;specially when there&#8217;s the laying-on of hands
and the Healing Springs. Oh, that was a pigsty game,
Scranton, that about God giving you the Healing
Springs, like Moses and the rock! Why, I discovered
them springs myself two years ago, before I went South,
and I guess God wasn&#8217;t helping me any&mdash;not after I&#8217;ve
kept out of His way as I have. But, anyhow, religion&#8217;s
real; that&#8217;s my sense of it; and you can get it, I bet,
if you try. I&#8217;ve seen it got. A friend of mine got it&mdash;got
it under your preaching; not from you; but you
was the accident that brought it about, I expect. It&#8217;s
funny&mdash;it&#8217;s merakilous, but it&#8217;s so. Kneel down!&#8221; he
added, with peremptory suddenness. &#8220;Kneel, Scranton!&#8221;</p>
<p>In fear the other knelt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to get religion now&mdash;here. You&#8217;re
going to pray for what you didn&#8217;t get&mdash;and almost got&mdash;in
the desert. You&#8217;re going to ask forgiveness for all
your damn tricks, and pray like a fanning-mill for the
Spirit to come down. You ain&#8217;t a scoundrel at heart&mdash;a
friend of mine says so. You&#8217;re a weak vessel&mdash;cracked,
perhaps. You&#8217;ve got to be saved, and start
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
right over again&mdash;and &#8216;Praise God from whom all
blessings flow!&#8217; Pray&mdash;pray, Scranton, and tell the
whole truth, and get it&mdash;get religion. Pray like blazes.
You go on, and pray out loud. Remember the desert,
and Mary Jewell, and your mother&mdash;did you have a
mother, Scranton?&mdash;say, did you have a mother, lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim&#8217;s voice suddenly lowered before the last word,
for the Faith Healer had broken down in a torrent of
tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my mother&mdash;O God!&#8221; he groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s right&mdash;that&#8217;s right&mdash;go on,&#8221; said the
other and drew back a little, and sat down on a log.</p>
<p>The man on his knees was convulsed with misery.
Denton, the world, disappeared. He prayed in agony.</p>
<p>Presently Tim moved uneasily, then got up and
walked about; and at last, with a strange, awed look,
when an hour was past, he stole back into the shadow
of the trees while still the wounded soul poured out its
misery and repentance.</p>
<p>Time moved on. A curious shyness possessed Tim
now, a thing which he had never felt in his life. He
moved about self-consciously, awkwardly, until at last
there was a sudden silence over by the brook.</p>
<p>Tim looked, and saw the face of the kneeling man
cleared and quiet and shining. He hesitated, then
stepped out, and came over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got it?&#8221; he asked, quietly. &#8220;It&#8217;s noon
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May God help me to redeem my past,&#8221; answered the
other, in a new voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it&mdash;sure?&#8221; Tim&#8217;s voice was meditative.</p>
<p>&#8220;God has spoken to me,&#8221; was the simple answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a friend&#8217;ll be glad to hear that,&#8221; he said;
and once more, in imagination, he saw Laura Sloly
standing at the door of her home, with a light in her eyes
he had never seen before.

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll want some money for your journey?&#8221; Tim
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want nothing but to go away&mdash;far away,&#8221; was the
low reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve lived in the desert&mdash;I guess you can
live in the grass-country,&#8221; came the dry response,
&#8220;Good-bye&mdash;and good-luck, Scranton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim turned to go, moved on a few steps, then looked
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid&mdash;they&#8217;ll not follow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
fix it for you all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the man appeared not to hear; he was still on
his knees.</p>
<p>Tim faced the woods once more.</p>
<p>He was about to mount his horse when he heard a
step behind him. He turned sharply&mdash;and faced Laura.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t rest. I came out this morning. I&#8217;ve seen
everything,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t trust me,&#8221; he said, heavily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never did anything else,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>He gazed half-fearfully into her eyes. &#8220;Well?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done my best, as I said I would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim,&#8221; she said, and slipped a hand in his, &#8220;would
you mind the religion&mdash;if you had me?&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
<h2>THE LITTLE WIDOW OF JANSEN</h2>
</div>

<p>Her advent to Jansen was propitious. Smallpox in
its most virulent form had broken out in the French-Canadian
portion of the town, and, coming with some
professional nurses from the East, herself an amateur,
to attend the sufferers, she worked with such skill and
devotion that the official thanks of the Corporation
were offered her, together with a tiny gold watch, the
gift of grateful citizens. But she still remained on at
Jansen, saying always, however, that she was &#8220;going East
in the spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five years had passed, and still she had not gone East,
but remained perched in the rooms she had first taken,
over the Imperial Bank, while the town grew up swiftly
round her. And even when the young bank manager
married, and wished to take over the rooms, she sent
him to the right-about from his own premises in her gay,
masterful way. The young manager behaved well in
the circumstances, because he had asked her to marry
him, and she had dismissed him with a warning against
challenging his own happiness&mdash;that was the way she
had put it. Perhaps he was galled the less because
others had striven for the same prize, and had been
thrust back, with an almost tender misgiving as to their
sense of self-preservation and sanity. Some of them
were eligible enough, and all were of some position in the
West. Yet she smiled them firmly away, to the wonder
of Jansen, and to its satisfaction, for was it not a tribute
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
to all that she would distinguish no particular unit by
her permanent favor? But for one so sprightly and
almost frivolous in manner at times, the self-denial
seemed incongruous. She was unconventional enough
to sit on the sidewalk with a half-dozen children round
her blowing bubbles, or to romp in any garden, or in the
street, playing Puss-in-the-ring; yet this only made her
more popular. Jansen&#8217;s admiration was at its highest,
however, when she rode in the annual steeplechase with
the best horsemen of the province. She had the gift of
doing as well as of being.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the light heart she has, and slippin&#8217; in and out
of things like a hummin&#8217;-bird, no easier to ketch and
no longer to stay,&#8221; said Finden, the rich Irish landbroker,
suggestively to Father Bourassa, the huge French-Canadian
priest who had worked with her through all
the dark weeks of the smallpox epidemic, and who
knew what lay beneath the outer gayety. She had been
buoyant of spirit beside the beds of the sick, and her
words were full of raillery and humor, yet there was
ever a gentle note behind all; and the priest had seen
her eyes shining with tears as she bent over some stricken
sufferer bound upon an interminable journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bedad! as bright a little spark as ever struck off
the steel,&#8221; added Finden to the priest, with a sidelong,
inquisitive look, &#8220;but a heart no bigger than a marrowfat
pea&mdash;selfishness, all self. Keepin&#8217; herself for herself
when there&#8217;s many a good man needin&#8217; her. Mother
o&#8217; Moses, how many! From Terry O&#8217;Ryan, brother
of a peer, at Latouche, to Bernard Bapty, son of a
millionaire, at Vancouver, there&#8217;s a string o&#8217; them.
All pride and self; and as fair a lot they&#8217;ve been as
ever entered for the Marriage Cup. Now isn&#8217;t that
so, father?&#8221;</p>
<p>Finden&#8217;s brogue did not come from a plebeian origin.
It was part of his commercial equipment, an asset of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
his boyhood spent among the peasants on the family
estate in Galway.</p>
<p>Father Bourassa fanned himself with the black broadbrim
hat he wore, and looked benignly but quizzically
on the wiry, sharp-faced Irishman.</p>
<p>&#8220;You t&#8217;ink her heart is leetla. But perhaps it is
your mind is not so big enough to see&mdash;<i>hien</i>?&#8221; The
priest laughed noiselessly, showing white teeth. &#8220;Was
it so selfish in Madame to refuse the name of Finden&mdash;<i>n&#8217;est-ce
pas</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Finden flushed, then burst into a laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;d almost
forgotten I was one of them&mdash;the first almost. Blessed
be he that expects nothing, for he&#8217;ll get it sure. It
was my duty, and I did it. Was she to feel that Jansen
did not price her high? Bedad, father, I rose betimes
and did it, before anny man should say he set me the
lead. Before the carpet in the parlor was down, and
with the bare boards soundin&#8217; to my words, I offered her
the name of Finden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so&mdash;the first of the long line! <i>Bien</i>, it is an
honor.&#8221; The priest paused a moment, looked at Finden
with a curious reflective look, and then said, &#8220;And so
you t&#8217;ink there is no one; that she will say yes not at
all&mdash;no?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were sitting on Father Bourassa&#8217;s verandah,
on the outskirts of the town, above the great river,
along which had travelled millions of bygone people,
fighting, roaming, hunting, trapping; and they could
hear it rushing past, see the swirling eddies, the impetuous
currents, the occasional rafts moving majestically
down the stream. They were facing the wild
North, while civilization was hacking and hewing and
ploughing its way to newer and newer cities, in an
empire ever spreading to the Pole.</p>
<p>Finden&#8217;s glance loitered on this scene before he replied.
At length, screwing up one eye, and with a suggestive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
smile, he answered: &#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s all a matter of time,
to the selfishest woman. &#8217;Tis not the same with women
as with men; you see, they don&#8217;t get younger&mdash;that&#8217;s a
point. But&#8221;&mdash;he gave a meaning glance at the priest&mdash;&#8220;but
perhaps she&#8217;s not going to wait for that, after all.
And there he rides, a fine figure of a man, too, if I have
to say it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;M&#8217;sieu&#8217; Varley?&#8221; the priest responded, and watched
a galloping horseman to whom Finden had pointed till
he rounded a corner of a little wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Varley, the great London surgeon, sure! Say, father,
it&#8217;s a hundred to one she&#8217;d take him if&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a curious look in Father Bourassa&#8217;s face,
a cloud in his eyes. He sighed. &#8220;London, it is ver&#8217;
far away,&#8221; he remarked, obliquely.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s to that? If she is with the right man, near
or far is nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far&mdash;from home,&#8221; said the priest, reflectively, but
his eyes furtively watched the other&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;But home&#8217;s where man and wife are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest now looked him straight in the eyes.
&#8220;Then, as you say, she will not marry M&#8217;sieu&#8217; Varley&mdash;<i>hein</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>The humor died out of Finden&#8217;s face. His eyes met
the priest&#8217;s eyes steadily. &#8220;Did I say that? Then my
tongue wasn&#8217;t making a fool of me, after all. How did
you guess I knew&mdash;everything, father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A priest knows many t&#8217;ings&mdash;so.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment of gloom, then the Irishman
brightened. He came straight to the heart of the
mystery around which they had been man&oelig;uvring.
&#8220;Have you seen her husband&mdash;Meydon&mdash;this year?
It isn&#8217;t his usual time to come yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Bourassa&#8217;s eyes drew those of his friend into
the light of a new understanding and revelation. They
understood and trusted each other.</p>

&#8220;AS PURTY A WOMAN, TOO&mdash;AS PURTY AND AS STRAIGHT BEWHILES&#8221;<br />

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>&#8220;<i>Hélas!</i> He is there in the hospital,&#8221; he answered,
and nodded toward a building not far away, which had
been part of an old Hudson Bay Company&#8217;s fort. It
had been hastily adapted as a hospital for the smallpox
victims.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Meydon, is it, that bad case I heard of
to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest nodded again and pointed. &#8220;<i>Voilà</i>, Madame
Meydon, she is coming. She has seen him&mdash;her
hoosban&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finden&#8217;s eyes followed the gesture. The little widow
of Jansen was coming from the hospital, walking slowly
toward the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;As purty a woman, too&mdash;as purty and as straight
bewhiles. What is the matter with him&mdash;with Meydon?&#8221;
Finden asked, after a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;An accident in the woods&mdash;so. He arrive, it is las&#8217;
night, from Great Slave Lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finden sighed. &#8220;Ten years ago he was a man to
look at twice&mdash;before he did <i>It</i> and got away. Now
his own mother wouldn&#8217;t know him&mdash;bad &#8217;cess to him!
I knew him from the cradle almost. I spotted him
here by a knife-cut I gave him in the hand when we
were lads together. A divil of a timper always both
of us had, but the good-nature was with me, and I
didn&#8217;t drink and gamble and carry a pistol. It&#8217;s ten
years since he did the killing, down in Quebec, and
I don&#8217;t suppose the police will get him now. He&#8217;s
been counted dead. I recognized him here the night
after I asked her how she liked the name of Finden.
She doesn&#8217;t know that I ever knew him. And he
didn&#8217;t recognize me&mdash;twenty-five years since we met
before! It would be better if he went under the sod.
Is he pretty sick, father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will die unless the surgeon&#8217;s knife it cure him
before twenty-four hours, and&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And Doctor Brydon is sick, and Doctor Hadley
away at Winnipeg, and this is two hundred miles from
nowhere! It looks as if the police&#8217;ll never get him,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not tell any one&mdash;never?&#8221;</p>
<p>Finden laughed. &#8220;Though I&#8217;m not a priest, I can lock
myself up as tight as anny. There&#8217;s no tongue that&#8217;s
so tied, when tying&#8217;s needed, as the one that babbles
most bewhiles. Babbling covers a lot of secrets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you t&#8217;ink it better Meydon should die, as Hadley
is away and Brydon is sick&mdash;<i>hein</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Finden stopped short, for a horse&#8217;s hoofs sounded on
the turf beside the house, and presently Varley, the
great London surgeon, rounded the corner and stopped
his horse in front of the veranda.</p>
<p>He lifted his hat to the priest. &#8220;I hear there&#8217;s a bad
case at the hospital,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is ver&#8217; dangerous,&#8221; answered Father Bourassa;
&#8220;but, <i>voilà</i>, come in! There is something cool to drink.
Ah, yes, he is ver&#8217; bad, that man from the Great Slave
Lake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inside the house, with the cooling drinks, Varley
pressed his questions, and presently, much interested,
told at some length of singular cases which had passed
through his hands&mdash;one a man with his neck broken,
who had lived for six months afterward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Broken as a man&#8217;s neck is broken by hanging&mdash;dislocation,
really&mdash;the disjointing of the <i>medulla oblongata</i>,
if you don&#8217;t mind technicalities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I kept
him living just the same. Time enough for him to repent
in and get ready to go. A most interesting case.
He was a criminal, too, and wanted to die; but you
have to keep life going if you can, to the last inch of
resistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priest looked thoughtfully out of the window;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
Finden&#8217;s eyes were screwed up in a questioning way,
but neither made any response to Varley&#8217;s remarks.
There was a long minute&#8217;s silence. They were all three
roused by hearing a light footstep on the veranda.</p>
<p>Father Bourassa put down his glass and hastened into
the hallway. Finden caught a glimpse of a woman&#8217;s
figure, and, without a word, passed abruptly from the
dining-room, where they were, into the priest&#8217;s study,
leaving Varley alone. Varley turned to look after him,
stared, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;The manners of the West,&#8221; he said, good-humoredly,
and turned again to the hallway, from whence came
the sound of the priest&#8217;s voice. Presently there was
another voice&mdash;a woman&#8217;s. He flushed slightly and involuntarily
straightened himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Valerie,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>An instant afterward she entered the room with the
priest. She was dressed in a severely simple suit of
gray, which set off to advantage her slim, graceful figure.
There seemed no reason why she should have been
called the little widow of Jansen, for she was not small,
but she was very finely and delicately made, and the
name had been but an expression of Jansen&#8217;s paternal
feeling for her. She had always had a good deal of
fresh color, but to-day she seemed pale, though her
eyes had a strange disturbing light. It was not that
they brightened on seeing this man before her; they
had been brighter, burningly bright, when she left the
hospital, where, since it had been built, she had been
the one visitor of authority&mdash;Jansen had given her that
honor. She had a gift of smiling, and she smiled now,
but it came from grace of mind rather than from humor.
As Finden had said, &#8220;She was forever acting, and never
doin&#8217; any harm by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly she was doing no harm by it now; nevertheless,
it was acting. Could it be otherwise, with what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
was behind her life&mdash;a husband who had ruined her
youth, had committed homicide, had escaped capture,
but who had not subsequently died, as the world believed
he had done, so circumstantial was the evidence. He
was not man enough to make the accepted belief in
his death a fact. What could she do but act, since the
day she got a letter from the Far North, which took her
out to Jansen, nominally to nurse those stricken with
smallpox under Father Bourassa&#8217;s care, actually to be
where her wretched husband could come to her once a
year, as he had asked with an impossible selfishness?</p>
<p>Each year she had seen him for an hour or less, giving
him money, speaking to him over a gulf so wide that
it seemed sometimes as though her voice could not be
heard across it; each year opening a grave to look at
the embalmed face of one who had long since died
in shame, which only brought back the cruellest of all
memories, that which one would give one&#8217;s best years
to forget. With a fortitude beyond description she
had faced it, gently, quietly, but firmly faced it&mdash;firmly,
because she had to be firm in keeping him within
those bounds the invasion of which would have killed
her. And after the first struggle with his unchangeable
brutality it had been easier: for into his degenerate
brain there had come a faint understanding of the
real situation and of her. He had kept his side of the
gulf, but gloating on this touch between the old luxurious,
indulgent life, with its refined vices, and this present
coarse, hard life, where pleasures were few and gross.
The free Northern life of toil and hardship had not
refined him. He greedily hung over this treasure,
which was not for his spending, yet was his own&mdash;as
though in a bank he had hoards of money which he
might not withdraw.</p>
<p>So the years had gone on, with their recurrent dreaded
anniversaries, carrying misery almost too great to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
borne by this woman mated to the loathed phantom
of a sad, dead life; and when this black day of each
year was over, for a few days afterwards she went
nowhere, was seen by none. Yet, when she did appear
again, it was with her old laughing manner, her cheerful
and teasing words, her quick response to the emotions
of others.</p>
<p>So it had gone till Varley had come to follow the
open-air life for four months, after a heavy illness due
to blood-poisoning got in his surgical work in London.
She had been able to live her life without too great a
struggle till he came. Other men had flattered her
vanity, had given her a sense of power, had made her
understand her possibilities, but nothing more&mdash;nothing
of what Varley brought with him. And before three
months had gone, she knew that no man had ever
interested her as Varley had done. Ten years before,
she would not have appreciated or understood him,
this intellectual, clean-shaven, rigidly abstemious man,
whose pleasures belonged to the fishing-rod and the
gun and the horse, and who had come to be so great
a friend of him who had been her best friend&mdash;Father
Bourassa. Father Bourassa had come to know the
truth&mdash;not from her, for she had ever been a Protestant,
but from her husband, who, Catholic by birth and a
renegade from all religion, had had a moment of spurious
emotion, when he went and confessed to Father Bourassa
and got absolution, pleading for the priest&#8217;s care of his
wife. Afterward Father Bourassa made up his mind
that the confession had a purpose behind it other than
repentance, and he deeply resented the use to which he
thought he was being put&mdash;a kind of spy upon the beautiful
woman whom Jansen loved, and who, in spite of
any outward flippancy, was above reproach.</p>
<p>In vital things the instinct becomes abnormally acute,
and, one day, when the priest looked at her commiseratingly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
she had divined what moved him. However it
was, she drove him into a corner with a question to
which he dare not answer yes, but to which he might
not answer no, and did not; and she realized that he
knew the truth, and she was the better for his knowing,
though her secret was no longer a secret. She was
not aware that Finden also knew. Then Varley came,
bringing a new joy and interest in her life, and a new
suffering also, for she realized that if she were free, and
Varley asked her to marry him, she would consent.</p>
<p>But when he did ask her, she said no with a pang
that cut her heart in two. He had stayed his four
months, and it was now six months, and he was going
at last&mdash;to-morrow. He had stayed to give her time to
learn to say yes, and to take her back with him to
London; and she knew that he would speak again to-day,
and that she must say no again; but she had kept him
from saying the words till now. And the man who
had ruined her life and had poisoned her true spirit
was come back broken and battered. He was hanging
between life and death; and now&mdash;for he was going to-morrow&mdash;Varley
would speak again.</p>
<p>The half-hour she had just spent in the hospital with
Meydon had tried her cruelly. She had left the building
in a vortex of conflicting emotions, with the call of duty
and of honor ringing through a thousand other voices
of temptation and desire, the inner pleadings for a little
happiness while yet she was young. After she married
Meydon, there had only been a few short weeks of joy
before her black disillusion came, and she had realized
how bitter must be her martyrdom.</p>
<p>When she left the hospital, she seemed moving in a
dream, as one intoxicated by some elixir might move
unheeding among event and accident and vexing life
and roaring multitudes. And all the while the river
flowing through the endless prairies, high-banked, ennobled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
by living woods, lipped with green, kept surging
in her ears, inviting her, alluring her&mdash;alluring her with
a force too deep and powerful for weak human nature
to bear for long. It would ease her pain, it said; it
would still the tumult and the storm; it would solve her
problem, it would give her peace. But as she moved
along the river-bank among the trees, she met the little
niece of the priest, who lived in his house, singing, as
though she was born but to sing, a song which Finden
had written and Father Bourassa had set to music.
Did not the distant West know Father Bourassa&#8217;s gift,
and did not Protestants attend Mass to hear him play
the organ afterward? The fresh, clear voice of the
child rang through the trees, stealing the stricken heart
away from the lure of the river:</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>She stood listening for a few moments, and, under
the spell of the fresh, young voice, the homely, heart-searching
words, and the intimate sweetness of the
woods, the despairing apathy lifted slowly away. She
started forward again with a new understanding, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
footsteps quickened. She would go to Father Bourassa.
He would understand. She would tell him all. He
would help her to do what now she knew she must do,
ask Leonard Varley to save her husband&#8217;s life&mdash;Leonard
Varley to save her husband&#8217;s life!</p>
<p>When she stepped upon the veranda of the priest&#8217;s
house, she did not know that Varley was inside. She
had no time to think. She was ushered into the room
where he was, with the confusing fact of his presence
fresh upon her. She had had but a word or two with
the priest, but enough for him to know what she meant
to do, and that it must be done at once.</p>
<p>Varley advanced to meet her. She shuddered inwardly
to think what a difference there was between
the fallen creature she had left behind in the hospital
and this tall, dark, self-contained man, whose name was
familiar in the surgeries of Europe, who had climbed
from being the son of a clockmaker to his present distinguished
place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you come for absolution, also?&#8221; he asked,
with a smile; &#8220;or is it to get a bill of excommunication
against your only enemy&mdash;there couldn&#8217;t be more
than one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cheerful as his words were, he was shrewdly observing
her, for her paleness and the strange light in her eyes
gave him a sense of anxiety. He wondered what trouble
was on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excommunication?&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>The unintended truth went home. She winced, even
as she responded with that quaint note in her voice
which gave humor to her speech. &#8220;Yes, excommunication,&#8221;
she replied; &#8220;but why an enemy? Do we not
need to excommunicate our friends sometimes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a hard saying,&#8221; he answered, soberly.</p>
<p>Tears sprang to her eyes, but she mastered herself,
and brought the crisis abruptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to save a man&#8217;s life,&#8221; she said, with her
eyes looking straight into his. &#8220;Will you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>His face grew grave and eager. &#8220;I want you to save
a man&#8217;s happiness,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Will you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That man yonder will die unless your skill saves
him,&#8221; she urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man here will go away unhappy and alone,
unless your heart befriends him,&#8221; he replied, coming
closer to her. &#8220;At sunrise to-morrow he goes.&#8221; He
tried to take her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please, please,&#8221; she pleaded, with a quick, protesting
gesture. &#8220;Sunrise is far off, but the man&#8217;s fate
is near, and you must save him. You only can do so,
for Doctor Hadley is away, and Doctor Brydon is sick,
and in any case Doctor Brydon dare not attempt the
operation alone. It is too critical and difficult, he says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have heard,&#8221; he answered, with a new note in
his voice, his professional instinct roused in spite of himself.
&#8220;Who is this man? What interests you in him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To how many unknown people have you given your
skill for nothing&mdash;your skill and all your experience to
utter strangers, no matter how low or poor! Is it not
so? Well, I cannot give to strangers what you have
given to so many, but I can help in my own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want me to see the man at once?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is his name? I know of his accident and the
circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated for an instant, then said, &#8220;He is called
Draper&mdash;a trapper and a woodsman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I was going away to-morrow at sunrise. All
my arrangements are made,&#8221; he urged, his eyes holding
hers, his passion swimming in his eyes again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will not see a man die, if you can save him?&#8221;
she pleaded, unable now to meet his look, its mastery
and its depth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>Her heart had almost leaped with joy at the suggestion
that he could not stay; but as suddenly self-reproach
and shame filled her mind, and she had challenged
him so. But yet, what right had she to sacrifice
this man she loved to the perverted criminal who had
spoiled her youth and taken away from her every dear
illusion of her life and heart? By every right of justice
and humanity she was no more the wife of Henry
Meydon than if she had never seen him. He had forfeited
every claim upon her, dragged in the mire her
unspotted life&mdash;unspotted, for in all temptation, in her
defenceless position, she had kept the whole commandment;
she had, while at the mercy of her own temperament,
fought her way through all, with a weeping heart
and laughing lips. Had she not longed for a little
home with a great love, and a strong, true man? Ah,
it had been lonely, bitterly lonely! Yet she had remained
true to the scoundrel, from whom she could
not free herself without putting him in the grasp of the
law to atone for his crime. She was punished for his
crimes; she was denied the exercise of her womanhood
in order to shield him. Still she remembered that once
she had loved him, those years ago, when he first won
her heart from those so much better than he, who loved
her so much more honestly; and this memory had
helped her in a way. She had tried to be true to it,
that dead, lost thing, of which this man who came once
a year to see her, and now, lying with his life at stake
in the hospital, was the repellent ghost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you will not see him die?&#8221; she urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to move you greatly what happens to this
man,&#8221; he said, his determined dark eyes searching hers,
for she baffled him. If she could feel so much for a
&#8220;casual,&#8221; why not a little more feeling for him? Suddenly,
as he drew her eyes to him again, there came
the conviction that they were full of feeling for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
They were sending a message, an appealing, passionate
message, which told him more than he had ever heard
from her or seen in her face before. Yes, she was his!
Without a word spoken she had told him so. What,
then, held her back? But women were a race by themselves,
and he knew that he must wait till she chose to
have him know what she had unintentionally conveyed
but now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am moved,&#8221; she continued, slowly. &#8220;Who
can tell what this man might do with his life if it is
saved! Don&#8217;t you think of that? It isn&#8217;t the importance
of a life that&#8217;s at stake; it&#8217;s the importance of
living; and we do not live alone, do we?&#8221;</p>
<p>His mind was made up. &#8220;I will not, cannot promise
anything till I have seen him. But I will go and see
him, and I&#8217;ll send you word later what I can do or not
do. Will that satisfy you? If I cannot do it, I will
come to say good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was set with suppressed feeling. She held
out her hand to him impulsively, and was about to
speak, but suddenly caught the hand away again from
his thrilling grasp and, turning hurriedly, left the room.
In the hall she met Father Bourassa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go with him to the hospital,&#8221; she whispered, and
disappeared through the doorway.</p>
<p>Immediately after she had gone, a man came driving
hard to bring Father Bourassa to visit a dying Catholic
in the prairie, and it was Finden who accompanied
Varley to the hospital, waited for him till his examination
of the &#8220;casual&#8221; was concluded, and met him outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it be done?&#8221; he asked of Varley. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
word to Father Bourassa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can be done&mdash;it will be done,&#8221; answered Varley,
absently. &#8220;I do not understand the man. He has
been in a different sphere of life. He tried to hide it,
but the speech&mdash;occasionally! I wonder.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You wonder if he&#8217;s worth saving?&#8221;</p>
<p>Varley shrugged his shoulders impatiently. &#8220;No;
that&#8217;s not what I meant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finden smiled to himself. &#8220;Is it a difficult case?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Critical and delicate; but it has been my specialty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the local doctors couldn&#8217;t do it, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They would be foolish to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are going away at sunrise to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; Varley&#8217;s voice was abrupt,
impatient.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you say so&mdash;everybody knows it.... That&#8217;s
a bad man yonder, Varley.&#8221; He jerked his thumb
toward the hospital. &#8220;A terrible bad man, he&#8217;s been.
A gentleman once, and fell down&mdash;fell down hard. He&#8217;s
done more harm than most men. He&#8217;s broken a woman&#8217;s
heart and spoiled her life, and, if he lives, there&#8217;s
no chance for her, none at all. He killed a man, and
the law wants him; and she can&#8217;t free herself without
ruining him; and she can&#8217;t marry the man she loves
because of that villain yonder, crying for his life to be
saved. By Josh and by Joan, but it&#8217;s a shame, a dirty
shame, it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly Varley turned and gripped his arm with
fingers of steel.</p>
<p>&#8220;His name&mdash;his real name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His name&#8217;s Meydon&mdash;and a dirty shame it is,
Varley.&#8221;</p>
<p>Varley was white. He had been leading his horse
and talking to Finden. He mounted quickly now, and
was about to ride away, but stopped short again. &#8220;Who
knows&mdash;who knows the truth?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father Bourassa and me&mdash;no others,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;I knew Meydon thirty years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s hesitation, then Varley said,
hoarsely, &#8220;Tell me&mdash;tell me all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>When all was told, he turned his horse toward the
wide waste of the prairie, and galloped away. Finden
watched him till he was lost to view beyond the bluff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, a man like that, you can&#8217;t guess what he&#8217;ll do,&#8221;
he said, reflectively. &#8220;He&#8217;s a high-stepper, and there&#8217;s
no telling what foolishness will get hold of him. It&#8217;d
be safer if he got lost on the prairie for twenty-four
hours. He said that Meydon&#8217;s only got twenty-four
hours, if the trick isn&#8217;t done! Well&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a penny from his pocket. &#8220;I&#8217;ll toss for it.
Heads he does it, and tails he doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tossed. It came down heads. &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s
one more fool in the world than I thought,&#8221; he said,
philosophically, as though he had settled the question;
as though the man riding away into the prairie with
a dark problem to be solved had told the penny what
he meant to do.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Mrs. Meydon, Father Bourassa, and Finden stood in
the little waiting-room of the hospital at Jansen, one
at each window, and watched the wild thunderstorm
which had broken over the prairie. The white heliographs
of the elements flashed their warnings across the
black sky, and the roaring artillery of the thunder came
after, making the circle of prairie and tree and stream
a theatre of anger and conflict. The streets of Jansen
were washed with flood, and the green and gold things
of garden and field and harvest crumbled beneath the
sheets of rain.</p>
<p>The faces at the window of the little room of the
hospital, however, were but half-conscious of the storm;
it seemed only an accompaniment of their thoughts, to
typify the elements of tragedy surrounding them.</p>
<p>For Varley there had been but one thing to do. A
life might be saved, and it was his duty to save it. He
had ridden back from the prairie as the sun was setting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
the night before, and had made all arrangements at the
hospital, giving orders that Meydon should have no
food whatever till the operation was performed the next
afternoon, and nothing to drink except a little brandy-and-water.</p>
<p>The operation was performed successfully, and Varley
had issued from the operating-room with the look of a
man who had gone through an ordeal which had taxed
his nerve to the utmost, to find Valerie Meydon waiting,
with a piteous, dazed look in her eyes. But this look
passed when she heard him say, &#8220;All right!&#8221;</p>
<p>The words brought a sense of relief, for if he had failed,
it would have seemed almost unbearable in the circumstances&mdash;the
cup of trembling must be drunk to the
dregs.</p>
<p>Few words had passed between them, and he had
gone, while she remained behind with Father Bourassa,
till the patient should wake from the sleep into which
he had fallen when Varley left.</p>
<p>But within two hours they sent for Varley again, for
Meydon was in evident danger. Varley had come, and
had now been with the patient for some time.</p>
<p>At last the door opened and Varley came in quickly.
He beckoned to Mrs. Meydon and to Father Bourassa.
&#8220;He wishes to speak with you,&#8221; he said to her. &#8220;There
is little time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes scarcely saw him, as she left the room and
passed to where Meydon lay nerveless, but with wide-open
eyes, waiting for her. The eyes closed, however,
before she reached the bed. Presently they opened
again, but the lids remained fixed. He did not hear
what she said.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>In the little waiting-room, Finden said to Varley,
&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Food was absolutely forbidden, but he got it from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
another patient early this morning while the nurse was
out for a moment. It has killed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas the least he could do, but no credit&#8217;s due him.
It was to be. I&#8217;m not envying Father Bourassa nor her
there with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Varley made no reply. He was watching the receding
storm with eyes which told nothing.</p>
<p>Finden spoke once more, but Varley did not hear
him. Presently the door opened and Father Bourassa
entered. He made a gesture of the hand to signify that
all was over.</p>
<p>Outside, the sun was breaking through the clouds
upon the Western prairie, and there floated through the
evening air the sound of a child&#8217;s voice singing beneath
the trees that fringed the river:</p>

<h2>WATCHING THE RISE OF ORION</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;In all the wide border his steed was the best,&#8221; and
the name and fame of Terence O&#8217;Ryan were known
from Strathcona to Qu&#8217;appelle. He had ambition of
several kinds, and he had the virtue of not caring who
knew of it. He had no guile, and little money; but
never a day&#8217;s work was too hard for him, and he took
bad luck, when it came, with a jerk of the shoulder
and a good-natured surprise on his clean-shaven face
that suited well his wide gray eyes and large, luxurious
mouth. He had an estate, half ranch, half farm, with
a French-Canadian manager named Vigon, an old
prospector who viewed every foot of land in the world
with the eye of the discoverer. Gold, coal, iron, oil,
he searched for them everywhere, making sure that
sooner or later he would find them. Once Vigon had
found coal. That was when he worked for a man called
Constantine Jopp, and had given him great profit; but
he, the discoverer, had been put off with a horse and a
hundred dollars. He was now as devoted to Terence
O&#8217;Ryan as he had been faithful to Constantine Jopp,
whom he cursed waking and sleeping.</p>
<p>In his time O&#8217;Ryan had speculated, and lost; he had
floated a coal-mine, and &#8220;been had&#8221;; he had run for the
local legislature, had been elected, and then unseated
for bribery committed by an agent; he had run races
at Regina, and won&mdash;he had won for three years in
succession; and this had kept him going and restored
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
his finances when they were at their worst. He was,
in truth, the best rider in the country, and, so far,
was the owner also of the best three-year-old that the
West had produced. He achieved popularity without
effort. The West laughed at his enterprises and loved
him; he was at once a public moral and a hero. It
was a legend of the West that his forebears had been
kings in Ireland like Brian Boroihme. He did not
contradict this; he never contradicted anything. His
challenge to all fun and satire and misrepresentation
was, &#8220;What&#8217;ll be the differ a hundred years from now!&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not use this phrase, however, toward one
experience&mdash;the advent of Miss Molly Mackinder, the
heiress, and the challenge that reverberated through the
West after her arrival. Philosophy deserted him then;
he fell back on the primary emotions of mankind.</p>
<p>A month after Miss Mackinder&#8217;s arrival at La Touche
a dramatic performance was given at the old fort, in
which the officers of the Mounted Police took part,
together with many civilians who fancied themselves.
By that time the district had realized that Terry O&#8217;Ryan
had surrendered to what they called &#8220;the laying on of
hands&#8221; by Molly Mackinder. It was not certain, however,
that the surrender was complete, because O&#8217;Ryan
had been wounded before, and yet had not been taken
captive altogether. His complete surrender seemed
now more certain to the public because the lady had a
fortune of two hundred thousand dollars, and that
amount of money would be useful to an ambitious man
in the growing West. It would, as Gow Johnson said,
&#8220;Let him sit back and view the landscape o&#8217;er before
he puts his ploughshare in the mud.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an out-door scene in the play produced by
the impetuous amateurs, and dialogue had been interpolated
by three &#8220;imps of fame&#8221; at the suggestion of
Constantine Jopp, one of the three, who bore malice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
toward O&#8217;Ryan, though this his colleagues did not
know distinctly. The scene was a camp-fire&mdash;a starlit
night, a colloquy between the three, upon which the
hero of the drama, played by Terry O&#8217;Ryan, should
break, after having, unknown to them, but in sight of
the audience, overheard their kind intentions toward
himself.</p>
<p>The night came. When the curtain rose for the third
act there was exposed a star-sown sky, in which the
galaxy of Orion was shown with distinctness, each star
sharply twinkling from the electric power behind&mdash;a
pretty scene, evoking great applause. O&#8217;Ryan had
never seen this back curtain&mdash;they had taken care
that he should not&mdash;and, standing in the wings awaiting
his cue, he was unprepared for the laughter of the
audience, first low and uncertain, then growing, then
insistent, and now a peal of ungovernable mirth, as one
by one they understood the significance of the stars
of Orion on the back curtain.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Ryan got his cue, and came on to an outburst of applause
which shook the walls. La Touche rose at him,
among them Miss Molly Mackinder in the front row
with the notables.</p>
<p>He did not see the back curtain, or Orion blazing in
the ultramarine blue. According to the stage directions,
he was to steal along the trees at the wings, and listen
to the talk of the men at the fire plotting against him,
who were presently to pretend good comradeship to his
face. It was a vigorous melodrama, with some touches
of true Western feeling. After listening for a moment,
O&#8217;Ryan was to creep up the stage again toward the back
curtain, giving a cue for his appearance.</p>
<p>When the hilarious applause at his entrance had
somewhat subsided, the three took up their parable, but
it was not the parable of the play. They used dialogue
not in the original. It had a significance which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
audience were not slow to appreciate, and went far to
turn <i>The Sunburst Trail</i> at this point into a comedy-farce.
When this new dialogue began, O&#8217;Ryan could
scarcely trust his ears or realize what was happening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, look,&#8221; said Dicky Fergus at the fire, &#8220;as fine a
night as I ever saw in the West! The sky&#8217;s a picture.
You could almost hand the stars down, they&#8217;re so near.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that clump together on the right&mdash;what
are they called in astronomy?&#8221; asked Constantine Jopp,
with a leer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Orion is the name&mdash;a beauty, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; answered
Fergus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been watching Orion rise,&#8221; said the third&mdash;Holden
was his name. &#8220;Many&#8217;s the time I&#8217;ve watched
Orion rising. Orion&#8217;s the star for me. Say, he wipes
&#8217;em all out&mdash;right out. Watch him rising now.&#8221;</p>
<p>By a manipulation of the lights Orion moved up the
back curtain slowly and blazed with light nearer the
zenith. And La Touche had more than the worth of
its money in this opening to the third act of the play.
O&#8217;Ryan was a favorite, at whom La Touche loved to
jeer, and the parable of the stars convulsed them.</p>
<p>At the first words O&#8217;Ryan put a hand on himself and
tried to grasp the meaning of it all, but his entrance and
the subsequent applause had confused him. Presently,
however, he turned to the back curtain, as Orion moved
slowly up the heavens, and found the key to the situation.
He gasped. Then he listened to the dialogue,
which had nothing to do with &#8220;<i>The Sunburst Trail</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Orion do, and why does he rise? Has
he got to rise? Why was the gent called Orion in them
far-off days?&#8221; asked Holden.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did some hunting in his time&mdash;with a club,&#8221;
Fergus replied. &#8220;He kept making hits, he did. Orion
was a spoiler. When he took the field there was no
room for the rest of the race. Why does he rise?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
Because it is a habit. They could always get a rise out
of Orion. The Athens <i>Eirenicon</i> said that yeast might
fail to rise, but touch the button and Orion would rise
like a bird.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that instant the galaxy jerked up the back curtain
again, and, when the audience could control itself,
Constantine Jopp, grinning meanly, asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does he wear the girdle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not a girdle&mdash;it is a belt,&#8221; was Dicky Fergus&#8217;
reply. &#8220;The gods gave it to him because he was a
favorite. There was a lady called Artemis&mdash;she was the
last of them. But he went visiting with Eos, another
lady of previous acquaintance, down at a place called
Ortygia, and Artemis shot him dead with a shaft Apollo
had given her; but she didn&#8217;t marry Apollo neither.
She laid Orion out on the sky, with his glittering belt
around him. And Orion keeps on rising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he ever stop rising?&#8221; asked Holden.</p>
<p>Followed for the conspirators a disconcerting moment;
for, when the laughter had subsided, a lazy voice came
from the back of the hall, &#8220;He&#8217;ll stop long enough to
play with Apollo a little, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Gow Johnson who had spoken, and no man
knew Terry O&#8217;Ryan better, or could gauge more truly
the course he would take. He had been in many an
enterprise, many a brush with O&#8217;Ryan, and his friendship
would bear any strain.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Ryan recovered himself from the moment he saw
the back curtain, and he did not find any fun in the
thing. It took a hold on him out of all proportion
to its importance. He realized that he had come to
the parting of the ways in his life. It suddenly came
upon him that something had been lacking in him
in the past, and that his want of success in many things
had not been wholly due to bad luck. He had been
eager, enterprising, a genius almost at seeing good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
things; and yet others had reaped where he had sown.
He had believed too much in his fellow-man. For the
first time in his life he resented the friendly, almost
affectionate satire of his many friends. It was amusing,
it was delightful; but down beneath it all there was a
little touch of ridicule. He had more brains than any
of them, and he had known it in a way; he had led
them sometimes, too, as on raids against cattle-stealers,
and in a brush with half-breeds and Indians; as when
he stood for the legislature; but he felt now for the first
time that he had not made the most of himself, that there
was something hurting to self-respect in this prank
played upon him. When he came to that point his
resentment went higher. He thought of Molly Mackinder,
and he heard all too acutely the vague veiled
references to her in their satire. By the time Gow
Johnson spoke he had mastered himself, however, and
had made up his mind. He stood still for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, please, my cue,&#8221; he said, quietly and satirically
from the trees near the wings.</p>
<p>He was smiling, but Gow Johnson&#8217;s prognostication
was right; and ere long the audience realized that he
was right. There was standing before them not the
Terry O&#8217;Ryan they had known, but another. He threw
himself fully into his part&mdash;a young rancher made deputy-sheriff,
who by the occasional exercise of his duty had
incurred the hatred of a small floating population that
lived by fraud, violence, and cattle-stealing. The conspiracy
was to raid his cattle, to lure him to pursuit,
to ambush him, and kill him. Terry now played the
part with a naturalness and force which soon lifted the
play away from the farcical element introduced into it by
those who had interpolated the gibes at himself. They
had gone a step too far.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going large,&#8221; said Gow Johnson, as the act drew
near its close and the climax neared where O&#8217;Ryan was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
to enter upon a physical struggle with his assailants.
&#8220;His blood&#8217;s up. There&#8217;ll be hell to pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Gow Johnson the play had instantly become
real, and O&#8217;Ryan an injured man at bay, the victim of
the act&mdash;not of the fictitious characters of the play,
but of the three men, Fergus, Holden, and Constantine
Jopp, who had planned the discomfiture of O&#8217;Ryan;
and he felt that the victim&#8217;s resentment would fall
heaviest on Constantine Jopp, the bully, an old schoolmate
of Terry&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Jopp was older than O&#8217;Ryan by three years, which
in men is little, but in boys, at a certain time of life,
is much. It means, generally, weight and height, an
advantage in a scrimmage. Constantine Jopp had been
the plague and tyrant of O&#8217;Ryan&#8217;s boyhood. He was
now a big, leering fellow, with much money of his own,
got chiefly from the coal discovered on his place by
Vigon, the half-breed French-Canadian. He had a
sense of dark and malicious humor, a long, horse-like
face, with little, beady eyes, and a huge frame.</p>
<p>Again and again had Terry fought him as a boy
at school, and often he had been badly whipped, but
he had never refused the challenge of an insult when
he was twelve and Jopp fifteen. The climax to their
enmity at school had come one day when Terry was
seized with a cramp while bathing, and after having
gone down twice was rescued by Jopp, who dragged
him out by the hair of the head. He had been restored
to consciousness on the bank and carried to his home,
where he lay ill for days. During the course of the
slight fever which followed the accident his hair was
cut close to his head. Impetuous always, his first
thought was to go and thank Constantine Jopp for
having saved his life. As soon as he was able he went
forth to find his rescuer, and met him suddenly on
turning a corner of the street. Before he could stammer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
out the gratitude that was in his heart, Jopp, eying him
with a sneering smile, said, drawlingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d had your hair cut like that I couldn&#8217;t have
got you out, could I? Holy, what a sight! Next time
I&#8217;ll take you by the scruff, putty face&mdash;bah!&#8221;</p>
<p>That was enough for Terry. He had swallowed the
insult, stuttered his thanks to the jeering laugh of the
lank bully, and had gone home and cried in shame and
rage.</p>
<p>It was the one real shadow in his life. Ill-luck and
good luck had been taken with an equable mind; but
the fact that he must, while he lived, own the supreme
debt of his life to a boy and afterward to a man whom
he hated by instinct was a constant cloud on him. Jopp
owned him. For some years they did not meet, and
then at last they again were thrown together in the West,
when Jopp settled at La Touche. It was gall and wormwood
to Terry, but he steeled himself to be friendly,
although the man was as great a bully as the boy, as
offensive in mind and character; but withal acute and
able in his way, and with a reputation for commercial
sharpness which would be called by another name in a
different civilization. They met constantly, and O&#8217;Ryan
always put a hand on himself, and forced himself to be
friendly. Once when Jopp became desperately ill there
had been&mdash;though he fought it down, and condemned
himself in every term of reproach&mdash;a sense of relief in
the thought that perhaps his ancient debt would now be
cancelled. It had gone on so long. And Constantine
Jopp had never lost an opportunity of vexing him, of
turturing him, of giving veiled thrusts, which he knew
O&#8217;Ryan could not resent. It was the constant pin-prick
of a mean soul, who had an advantage of which he could
never be dispossessed&mdash;unless the ledger was balanced
in some inscrutable way.</p>
<p>Apparently bent on amusement only, and hiding his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
hatred from his colleagues, Jopp had been the instigator
and begetter of the huge joke of the play; but it was
the brains of Dick Fergus which had carried it out,
written the dialogue, and planned the electric appliances
of the back curtain&mdash;for he was an engineer and
electrician. Neither he nor Holden had known the
old antipathy of Terry and Constantine Jopp. There
was only one man who knew the whole truth, and that
was Gow Johnson, to whom Terry had once told all.
At the last moment Fergus had interpolated certain
points in the dialogue which were not even included at
rehearsal. These referred to Apollo. He had a shrewd
notion that Jopp had an idea of marrying Molly Mackinder
if he could, cousins though they were; and he
was also aware that Jopp, knowing Molly&#8217;s liking for
Terry, had tried to poison her mind against him, through
suggestive gossip about a little widow at Jansen, thirty
miles away. He had in so far succeeded that, on the
very day of the performance, Molly had declined to be
driven home from the race-course by Terry, despite the
fact that Terry had won the chief race and owned the
only dog-cart in the West.</p>
<p>As the day went on, Fergus realized, as had Gow
Johnson, that Jopp had raised a demon. The air was
electric. The play was drawing near to its climax&mdash;an
attempt to capture the deputy-sheriff, tie him to a tree,
and leave him bound and gagged alone in the waste.
There was a glitter in Terry&#8217;s eyes, belying the lips
which smiled in keeping with the character he presented.
A look of harshness was stamped on his face, and the
outlines of the temples were as sharp as the chin was set
and the voice slow and penetrating.</p>
<p>Molly Mackinder&#8217;s eyes were riveted on him. She
sat very still, her hands clasped in her lap, watching his
every move. Instinct told her that Terry was holding
himself in; that some latent fierceness and iron force
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
in him had emerged into life; and that he meant to
have revenge on Constantine Jopp one way or another,
and that soon; for she had heard the rumor flying
through the hall that her cousin was the cause of the
practical joke just played. From hints she had had
from Constantine that very day she knew that the
rumor was the truth; and she recalled now with shrinking
dislike the grimace accompanying the suggestion.
She had not resented it then, being herself angry with
Terry because of the little widow at Jansen.</p>
<p>Presently the silence in the hall became acute; the
senses of the audience were strained to the utmost.
The acting before them was more realistic than anything
they had ever seen, or were ever likely to see
again in La Touche. All three conspirators, Fergus,
Holden, and Jopp, realized that O&#8217;Ryan&#8217;s acting had
behind it an animal anger which transformed him.
When he looked into their eyes it was with a steely
directness harder and fiercer than was observed by the
audience. Once there was an occasion for O&#8217;Ryan to
catch Fergus by the arm, and Fergus winced from the
grip. When standing in the wings with Terry he
ventured to apologize playfully for the joke, but Terry
made no answer; and once again he had whispered
good-naturedly as they stood together on the stage;
but the reply had been a low, scornful laugh. Fergus
realized that a critical moment was at hand. The play
provided for some dialogue between Jopp and Terry,
and he observed with anxiety that Terry now interpolated
certain phrases meant to warn Constantine, and
to excite him to anger also.</p>
<p>The moment came upon them sooner than the text
of the play warranted. O&#8217;Ryan deliberately left out
several sentences, and gave a later cue, and the struggle
for his capture was precipitated. Terry meant to make
the struggle real. So thrilling had been the scene that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
to an extent the audience was prepared for what followed;
but they did not grasp the full reality&mdash;that
the play was now only a vehicle for a personal issue
of a desperate character. No one had ever seen O&#8217;Ryan
angry; and now that the demon of rage was on him,
directed by a will suddenly grown to its full height,
they saw not only a powerful character in a powerful
melodrama, but a man of wild force. When the three
desperadoes closed in on O&#8217;Ryan, and, with a blow
from the shoulder which was not a pretence, he sent
Holden into a far corner gasping for breath and moaning
with pain, the audience broke out into wild cheering.
It was superb acting, they thought. As most of them
had never seen the play, they were not surprised when
Holden did not again join the attack on the deputy-sheriff.
Those who did know the drama&mdash;among them
Molly Mackinder&mdash;became dismayed, then anxious.</p>
<p>Fergus and Jopp knew well from the blow O&#8217;Ryan
had given that, unless they could drag him down, the
end must be disaster to some one. They were struggling
with him for personal safety now. The play was forgotten,
though mechanically O&#8217;Ryan and Fergus repeated
the exclamations and the few phrases belonging
to the part. Jopp was silent, fighting with a malice
which belongs to only half-breed, or half-bred, natures;
and from far back in his own nature the distant Indian
strain in him was working in savage hatred. The two
were desperately hanging onto O&#8217;Ryan like pumas on
a grizzly, when suddenly, with a twist he had learned
from Ogami the Jap on the Smoky River, the slim
Fergus was slung backward to the ground with the tendons
of his arm strained and the arm itself useless for
further work. There remained now Constantine Jopp,
heavier and more powerful than O&#8217;Ryan.</p>
<p>For O&#8217;Ryan the theatre, the people, disappeared.
He was a boy again on the village-green, with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
bully before him who had tortured his young days.
He forgot the old debt to the foe who saved his life;
he forgot everything except that once again, as of old,
Constantine Jopp was fighting him, with long, strong
arms trying to bring him to the ground. Jopp&#8217;s superior
height gave him an advantage in a close grip; the
strength of his gorilla-like arms was difficult to withstand.
Both were forgetful of the world, and the two
other injured men, silent and awed, were watching the
fight, in which one of them, at least, was powerless to
take part.</p>
<p>The audience was breathless. Most now saw the
grim reality of the scene before them; and when at
last O&#8217;Ryan&#8217;s powerful right hand got a grip upon the
throat of Jopp, and they saw the grip tighten, tighten,
and Jopp&#8217;s face go from red to purple, a hundred people
gasped. Excited men made as though to move toward
the stage; but the majority still believed that it all
belonged to the play, and shouted, &#8220;Sit down!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the voice of Gow Johnson was heard:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t kill him&mdash;let go, boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice rang out with sharp anxiety, and pierced
the fog of passion and rage in which O&#8217;Ryan was moving.
He realized what he was doing, the real sense of it came
upon him. Suddenly he let go the lank throat of his
enemy, and, by a supreme effort, flung him across the
stage, where Jopp lay resting on his hands, his bleared
eyes looking at Terry with the fear and horror still
in them which had come with that tightening grip on
his throat.</p>
<p>Silence fell suddenly on the theatre. The audience
was standing. A woman sobbed somewhere in a far
corner, but the rest were dismayed and speechless.
A few steps before them all was Molly Mackinder,
white and frightened, but in her eyes was a look of
understanding as she gazed at Terry. Breathing hard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
Terry stood still in the middle of the stage, the red fog
not yet gone out of his eyes, his hands clasped at his
side, vaguely realizing the audience again. Behind him
was the back curtain, in which the lights of Orion twinkled
aggressively. The three men who had attacked him
were still where he had thrown them.</p>
<p>The silence was intense, the strain oppressive. But
now a drawling voice came from the back of the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you watching the rise of Orion?&#8221; it said. It
was the voice of Gow Johnson.</p>
<p>The strain was broken; the audience dissolved in
laughter; but it was not hilarious; it was the nervous
laughter of relief, touched off by a native humor always
present in the dweller of the prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Terry, quietly and abstractedly,
to the audience.</p>
<p>And the scene-shifter bethought himself and let down
the curtain.</p>
<p>The fourth act was not played that night. The people
had had more than the worth of their money. In
a few moments the stage was crowded with people from
the audience, but both Jopp and O&#8217;Ryan had disappeared.</p>
<p>Among the visitors to the stage was Molly Mackinder.
There was a meaning smile upon her face as she said
to Dicky Fergus:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was quite wonderful, wasn&#8217;t it&mdash;like a scene out
of the classics&mdash;the gladiators or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fergus gave a wary smile as he answered: &#8220;Yes. I
felt like saying &#8216;<i>Ave, Cæsar, ave!</i>&#8217; and I watched to see
Artemis drop her handkerchief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She dropped it, but you were too busy to pick it up.
It would have been a useful sling for your arm,&#8221; she
added, with thoughtful malice. &#8220;It seemed so real&mdash;you
all acted so well, so appropriately. And how you
keep it up!&#8221; she added, as he cringed when some one
knocked against his elbow, hurting the injured tendons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>Fergus looked at her meditatively before he answered.
&#8220;Oh, I think we&#8217;ll likely keep it up for some time,&#8221;
he rejoined, ironically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the play isn&#8217;t finished?&#8221; she added. &#8220;There
is another act? Yes, I thought there was; the programme
said four.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, there&#8217;s another act,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but
it isn&#8217;t to be played now; and I&#8217;m not in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I suppose you are not in it. You really weren&#8217;t
in the last act. Who will be in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fergus suddenly laughed outright as he looked at
Holden expostulating intently to a crowd of people
round him. &#8220;Well, honor bright, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll
be anybody in it except little Conny Jopp and gentle
Terry O&#8217;Ryan; and Conny mayn&#8217;t be in it very long.
But he&#8217;ll be in it for a while, I guess. You see, the curtain
came down in the middle of a situation, not at the
end of it. The curtain has to rise again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Orion will rise again&mdash;you think so?&#8221;
She laughed in satire; for Dicky Fergus had made love
to her during the last three months with unsuppressed
activity, and she knew him in his sentimental moments;
which is fatal. It is fatal if, in a duet, one breathes
fire and the other frost.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want my opinion,&#8221; he said, in a lower voice,
as they moved toward the door, while people tried to
listen to them&mdash;&#8220;if you want it straight, I think Orion
has risen&mdash;right up where shines the evening star&mdash;Oh,
say, now,&#8221; he broke off, &#8220;haven&#8217;t you had enough
fun out of me? I tell you, it was touch and go. He
nearly broke my arm&mdash;would have done it, if I hadn&#8217;t
gone limp to him; and your cousin Conny Jopp, little
Conny Jopp, was as near Kingdom Come as a man
wants at his age. I saw an elephant go <i>must</i> once in
India, and it was as like O&#8217;Ryan as putty is to dough.
It isn&#8217;t all over, either, for O&#8217;Ryan will forget and forgive,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
and Jopp won&#8217;t. He&#8217;s your cousin, but he&#8217;s a sulker.
If he has to sit up nights to do it, he&#8217;ll try to get back
on O&#8217;Ryan. He&#8217;ll sit up nights, but he&#8217;ll do it, if he
can. And, whatever it is, it won&#8217;t be pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside the door they met Gow Johnson, excitement
in his eyes. He heard Fergus&#8217; last words.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll see Orion rising if he sits up nights,&#8221; Gow
Johnson said. &#8220;The game is with Terry&mdash;at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he called to the dispersing, gossiping crowd:
&#8220;Hold on&mdash;hold on, you people! I&#8217;ve got news for
you. Folks, this is O&#8217;Ryan&#8217;s night. It&#8217;s his in the starry
firmament. Look at him shine!&#8221; he cried, stretching
out his arm toward the heavens, where the glittering
galaxy hung near the zenith. &#8220;Terry O&#8217;Ryan&mdash;our
O&#8217;Ryan&mdash;he&#8217;s struck oil&mdash;on his ranch it&#8217;s been struck.
Old Vigon found it. Terry&#8217;s got his own at last.
O&#8217;Ryan&#8217;s in it&mdash;in it alone. Now, let&#8217;s hear the prairie-whisper!&#8221;
he shouted, in a great, raucous voice. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
hear the prairie-whisper! What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd responded in a hoarse shout for O&#8217;Ryan
and his fortune. Even the women shouted&mdash;all except
Molly Mackinder. She was wondering if O&#8217;Ryan risen
would be the same to her as O&#8217;Ryan rising. She got
into her carriage with a sigh, though she said to the few
friends with her:</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s splendid. He deserves it, too. Oh,
I&#8217;m glad&mdash;I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; She laughed; but the laugh
was a little hysterical.</p>
<p>She was both glad and sorry. Yet as she drove home
over the prairie she was silent. Far off in the east was
a bright light. It was a bonfire built on O&#8217;Ryan&#8217;s ranch,
near where he had struck oil&mdash;struck it rich. The
light grew and grew, and the prairie was alive with people
hurrying toward it. La Touche should have had the
news hours earlier, but the half-breed French-Canadian,
Vigon, who had made the discovery, and had started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
for La Touche with the news, went suddenly off his
head with excitement, and had ridden away into the
prairie fiercely shouting his joy to an invisible world.
The news had been brought in later by a farm-hand.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Terry O&#8217;Ryan had really struck oil, and his ranch was
a scene of decent revelry, of which Gow Johnson was
master. But the central figure of it all, the man who
had, in truth, risen like a star, had become to La Touche
all at once its notoriety as well as its favorite, its great
man as well as its friend, he was nowhere to be found.
He had been seen riding full speed into the prairie toward
the Kourmash Wood, and the starlit night had swallowed
him. Constantine Jopp had also disappeared; but at
first no one gave that thought or consideration.</p>
<p>As the night went on, however, a feeling began to stir
which it is not good to rouse in frontier lands. It is
sure to exhibit itself in forms more objective than are
found in great populations where methods of punishment
are various, and even when deadly are often refined.
But society in new places has only limited
resources, and is thrown back on primary ways and
means. La Touche was no exception, and the keener
spirits, to whom O&#8217;Ryan had ever been &#8220;a white man,&#8221;
and who so rejoiced in his good-luck now that they
drank his health a hundred times in his own whiskey
and cider, were simmering with desire for a public
reproval of Constantine Jopp&#8217;s conduct. Though it was
pointed out to them by the astute Gow Johnson that
Fergus and Holden had participated in the colossal
joke of the play, they had learned indirectly also the
whole truth concerning the past of the two men. They
realized that Fergus and Holden had been duped by
Jopp into the escapade. Their primitive sense of justice
exonerated the humorists and arraigned the one malicious
man. As the night wore on they decided on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
punishment to be meted out by La Touche to the man
who had not &#8220;acted on the square.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gow Johnson saw, too late, that he had roused a spirit
as hard to appease as the demon roused in O&#8217;Ryan
earlier in the evening. He would have enjoyed the
<i>battue</i> of punishment under ordinary circumstances; but
he knew that Miss Molly Mackinder would be humiliated
and indignant at the half-savage penalty they meant to
exact. He had determined that O&#8217;Ryan should marry
her; and this might be an obstruction in the path. It
was true that O&#8217;Ryan now would be a rich man&mdash;one
of the richest in the West, unless all signs failed; but,
meanwhile, a union of fortunes would only be an added
benefit. Besides, he had seen that O&#8217;Ryan was in
earnest, and what O&#8217;Ryan wanted he himself wanted
even more strongly. He was not concerned greatly for
O&#8217;Ryan&#8217;s absence. He guessed that Terry had ridden
away into the night to work off the dark spirit that was
on him, to have it out with himself. Gow Johnson was
a philosopher. He was twenty years older than O&#8217;Ryan,
and he had studied his friend as a pious monk his missal.</p>
<p>He was right in his judgment. When Terry left the
theatre he was like one in a dream, every nerve in his
body at tension, his head aflame, his pulses throbbing.
For miles he rode away into the waste along the northern
trail, ever away from La Touche and his own home.
He did not know of the great good-fortune that had
come to him; and if, in this hour, he had known, he would
not have cared. As he rode on and on remorse drew
him into its grasp. Shame seized him that he had let
passion be his master, that he had lost his self-control,
had taken a revenge out of all proportion to the injury
and insult to himself. It did not ease his mind that he
knew Constantine Jopp had done the thing out of meanness
and malice; for he was alive to-night in the light
of the stars, with the sweet, crisp air blowing in his face,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
because of an act of courage on the part of his school-days&#8217;
foe. He remembered now that, when he was
drowning, he had clung to Jopp with frenzied arms
and had endangered the bully&#8217;s life also. The long
torture of owing this debt to so mean a soul was on him
still, was rooted in him; but suddenly, in the silent,
searching night, some spirit whispered in his ear that
this was the price which he must pay for his life saved
to the world, a compromise with the Inexorable Thing.
On the verge of oblivion and the end, he had been
snatched back by relenting Fate, which requires something
for something given when laws are overriden and
doom defeated. Yes, the price he was meant to pay
was gratitude to one of shrivelled soul and innate antipathy;
and he had not been man enough to see the
trial through to the end! With a little increased strain
put upon his vanity and pride, he had run amuck. Like
some heathen gladiator, he had ravaged in the ring.
He had gone down into the basements of human life
and there made a cockpit for his animal rage, till, in
the contest, brain and intellect had been saturated by
the fumes and sweat of fleshly fury.</p>
<p>How quiet the night was, how soothing to the fevered
mind and body, how the cool air laved the heated head
and flushed the lungs of the rheum of passion! He
rode on and on, farther and farther away from home, his
back upon the scenes where his daily deeds were done.
It was long past midnight before he turned his horse&#8217;s
head again homeward.</p>
<p>Buried in his thoughts, now calm and determined,
with a new life grown up in him, a new strength different
from the mastering force which gave him a strength
in the theatre like one in a delirium, he noticed nothing.
He was only conscious of the omniscient night and its
warm, penetrating friendliness; as, in a great trouble,
when no words can be spoken, a cool, kind palm steals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
into the trembling hand of misery and stills it, gives it
strength and life and an even pulse. He was now master
in the house of his soul, and had no fear or doubt as to
the future or as to his course.</p>
<p>His first duty was to go to Constantine Jopp and
speak his regret like a man. And after that it would
be his duty to carry a double debt his life long for the
life saved, for the wrong done. He owed an apology
to La Touche, and he was scarcely aware that the
native gentlemanliness in him had said through his
fever of passion over the footlights, &#8220;I beg your pardon.&#8221;
In his heart he felt that he had offered a mean affront
to every person present, to the town where his interests
lay, where his heart lay.</p>
<p>Where his heart lay&mdash;Molly Mackinder! He knew
now that vanity had something to do, if not all to do,
with his violent acts, and though there suddenly shot
through his mind, as he rode back, a savage thrill at the
remembrance of how he had handled the three, it was
only a passing emotion. He was bent on putting
himself right with Jopp and with La Touche. With
the former his way was clear; he did not yet see his
way as to La Touche. How would he be able to make
the <i>amende honorable</i> to La Touche?</p>
<p>By-and-by he became somewhat less absorbed and
enveloped by the comforting night. He saw the
glimmer of red light afar, and vaguely wondered what it
was. It was in the direction of O&#8217;Ryan&#8217;s Ranch, but he
thought nothing of it, because it burned steadily. It
was probably a fire lighted by settlers trailing to the
farther North. While the night wore on he rode as
slowly back to the town as he had galloped from it
like a centaur with a captive.</p>
<p>Again and again Molly Mackinder&#8217;s face came before
him, but he resolutely shut it out of his thoughts. He
felt that he had no right to think of her until he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
&#8220;done the right thing&#8221; by Jopp and by La Touche.
Yet the look in her face as the curtain came down,
it was not that of one indifferent to him or to what he
did. He neared the town half-way between midnight
and morning. Almost unconsciously avoiding the main
streets, he rode a roundabout way toward the little
house where Constantine Jopp lived. He could hear
loud noises in the streets, singing, and hoarse shouts.
Then silence came, then shouts, and silence again. It
was all quiet as he rode up to Jopp&#8217;s house, standing
on the outskirts of the town. There was a bright light
in the window of a room.</p>
<p>Jopp, then, was still up. He would not wait till
to-morrow. He would do the right thing now. He
would put things straight with his foe before he slept;
he would do it at any sacrifice to his pride. He had
conquered his pride.</p>
<p>He dismounted, threw the bridle over a post, and,
going into the garden, knocked gently at the door.
There was no response. He knocked again, and listened
intently. Now he heard a sound&mdash;like a smothered cry
or groan. He opened the door quickly and entered.
It was dark. In another room beyond was a light.
From it came the same sound he had heard before, but
louder; also there was a shuffling footstep. Springing
forward to the half-open door, he pushed it wide, and
met the terror-stricken eyes of Constantine Jopp&mdash;the
same look that he had seen at the theatre when his
hands were on Jopp&#8217;s throat, but more ghastly.</p>
<p>Jopp was bound to a chair by a lasso. Both arms
were fastened to the chair-arm, and beneath them, on the
floor, were bowls into which blood dropped from his
punctured wrists.</p>
<p>He had hardly taken it all in&mdash;the work of an instant&mdash;when
he saw crouched in a corner, madness in his
eyes, his half-breed Vigon. He grasped the situation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
in a flash. Vigon had gone mad, had lain in wait in
Jopp&#8217;s house, and, when the man he hated had seated
himself in the chair, had lassoed him, bound him, and
was slowly bleeding him to death.</p>
<p>He had no time to think. Before he could act
Vigon was upon him also, frenzy in his eyes, a knife
clutched in his hand. Reason had fled, and he only
saw in O&#8217;Ryan the frustrator of his revenge. He had
watched the drip, drip from his victim&#8217;s wrists with
a dreadful joy.</p>
<p>They were man and man, but O&#8217;Ryan found in this
grisly contest a vaster trial of strength than in the
fight upon the stage a few hours ago. The first lunge
that Vigon made struck him on the tip of the shoulder
and drew blood; but he caught the hand holding the
knife in an iron grasp, while the half-breed, with superhuman
strength, tried in vain for the long, brown throat
of the man for whom he had struck oil. As they
struggled and twisted, the eyes of the victim in the
chair watched them with agonized emotions. For him
it was life or death. He could not cry out&mdash;his mouth
was gagged; but to O&#8217;Ryan his groans were like a distant
echo of his own hoarse gasps as he fought his desperate
fight. Terry was as one in an awful dream battling with
vague, impersonal powers which slowly strangled his life,
yet held him back in torture from the final surrender.</p>
<p>For minutes they struggled. At last O&#8217;Ryan&#8217;s
strength came to a point of breaking, for Vigon was a
powerful man, and to this was added a madman&#8217;s
energy. He felt that the end was coming. But all at
once, through the groans of the victim in the chair,
Terry became conscious of noises outside&mdash;such noises
as he had heard before he entered the house, only
nearer and louder. At the same time he heard a
horse&#8217;s hoofs, then a knock at the door, and a voice
calling, &#8220;Jopp! Jopp!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>He made a last desperate struggle, and shouted
hoarsely.</p>
<p>An instant later there were footsteps in the room,
followed by a cry of fright and amazement.</p>
<p>It was Gow Johnson. He had come to warn Constantine
Jopp that a crowd were come to tar and feather
him, and to get him away on his own horse.</p>
<p>Now he sprang to the front door, called to the approaching
crowd for help, then ran back to help O&#8217;Ryan.
A moment later a dozen men had Vigon secure, and had
released Constantine Jopp, now almost dead from loss
of blood.</p>
<p>As they took the gag from his mouth and tied their
handkerchiefs round his bleeding wrists, Jopp sobbed
aloud. His eyes were fixed on Terry O&#8217;Ryan. Terry
met the look, and grasped the limp hand lying on the
chair-arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, O&#8217;Ryan, I&#8217;m sorry for all I&#8217;ve done to you,&#8221;
Jopp sobbed. &#8220;I was a sneak, but I want to own it. I
want to be square now. You can tar and feather me, if
you like. I deserve it.&#8221; He looked at the others. &#8220;I
deserve it,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the boys had thought would be appropriate,&#8221;
said Gow Johnson, with a dry chuckle, and the
crowd looked at one another and winked. The wink
was kindly, however. &#8220;To own up and take your
gruel!&#8221; was the easiest way to touch the men of the
prairie.</p>
<p>A half-hour later the roisterers, who had meant to
carry Constantine Jopp on a rail, carried Terry O&#8217;Ryan
on their shoulders through the town, against his will.
As they passed the house where Miss Mackinder lived,
some one shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you watching the rise of Orion?&#8221;</p>
<p>Many a time thereafter Terry O&#8217;Ryan and Molly
Mackinder looked at the galaxy in the evening sky with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
laughter and with pride. It had played its part with
Fate against Constantine Jopp and the little widow at
Jansen. It had never shone so brightly as on the night
when Vigon struck oil on O&#8217;Ryan&#8217;s ranch. But Vigon
had no memory of that. Such is the irony of life.</p>

<p>A great naval gun never fires twice alike. It varies from day

<p>&#8220;Thirty millions&mdash;I think not.&#8221;</p>

was William Goatry&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<p>A loud laugh followed, for Billy Goat was a popular
person at Kowatin, in the Saskatchewan country. He
had an inimitable drollery, heightened by a cast in his
eye, a very large mouth, and a round, good-humored
face; also he had a hand and arm like iron, and was
altogether a great man on a &#8220;spree.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>There had been a two days&#8217; spree at Kowatin, for no
other reason than that there had been great excitement
over the capture and subsequent escape of a prairie-rover
who had robbed the contractor&#8217;s money-chest
at the rail-head on the Canadian Pacific Railroad.
Forty miles from Kowatin he had been caught by,
and escaped from, the tall, brown-eyed man with the
hard-bitten face who leaned against the open window
of the tavern, looking indifferently at the jeering crowd
before him. For a police officer, he was not unpopular
with them, but he had been a failure for once, and, as
Billy Goat had said, &#8220;It tickled us to death to see a
rider of the plains off his trolley&mdash;on the cold, cold
ground, same as you and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did not undervalue him. If he had been less a
man than he was, they would not have taken the trouble
to cover him with their drunken ribaldry. He had
scored off them in the past in just such sprees as this,
when he had the power to do so, and used the power
good-naturedly and quietly&mdash;but used it.</p>
<p>Then he was Sergeant Foyle, of the Royal Northwest
Mounted Police, on duty in a district as large as the
United Kingdom. And he had no greater admirer than
Billy Goat, who now reviled him. Not without cause,
in a way, for he had reviled himself to this extent
that, when the prairie-rover, Halbeck, escaped on the
way to Prince Albert, after six months&#8217; hunt for him
and a final capture in the Kowatin district, Foyle resigned
the Force before the Commissioner could reproach
him or call him to account. Usually so exact,
so certain of his target, some care had not been taken,
he had miscalculated, and there had been the Error of
the Day. Whatever it was, it had seemed to him fatal;
and he had turned his face from the barrack-yard.</p>
<p>Then he had made his way to the Happy Land
Hotel at Kowatin, to begin life as &#8220;a free and independent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
gent on the loose,&#8221; as Billy Goat had said. To
resign had seemed extreme; because, though the Commissioner
was vexed at Halbeck&#8217;s escape, Foyle was
the best non-commissioned officer in the Force. He
had frightened horse-thieves and bogus land-agents
and speculators out of the country; had fearlessly
tracked down a criminal or a band of criminals when
the odds were heavy against him. He carried on his
cheek the scars of two bullets, and there was one white
lock in his brown hair where an arrow had torn the
scalp away as, alone, he drove into the Post a score of
Indians, fresh from raiding the cattle of an immigrant
trailing north.</p>
<p>Now he was out of work, or so it seemed; he had
stepped down from his scarlet-coated dignity, from the
place of guardian and guide to civilization, into the
idleness of a tavern stoop.</p>
<p>As the little group swayed round him, and Billy Goat
started another song, Foyle roused himself as though to
move away&mdash;he was waiting for the mail-stage to take
him south&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>

<p>The song arrested him, and he leaned back against
the window again. A curious look came into his eyes,
a look that had nothing to do with the acts of the
people before him. It was searching into a scene beyond
this bright sunlight and the far green-brown
grass, and the little oasis of trees in the distance marking
a homestead, and the dust of the wagon-wheels out
on the trail beyond the grain-elevator&mdash;beyond the
blue horizon&#8217;s rim, quivering in the heat, and into regions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
where this crisp, clear, life-giving, life-saving air
never blew.</p>

<p>He remembered when he had first heard this song in
a play called <i>Ten Nights in a Bar-Room</i>, many years
before, and how it had wrenched his heart and soul, and
covered him with a sudden cloud of shame and anger.
For his father had been a drunkard, and his brother had
grown up a drunkard, that brother whom he had not
seen for ten years until&mdash;until&mdash;</p>
<p>He shuddered, closed his eyes, as though to shut out
something that the mind saw. He had had a rough
life, he had become inured to the seamy side of things&mdash;there
was a seamy side even in this clean, free, wide
land; and he had no sentimentality; though something
seemed to hurt and shame him now.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>

<p>The crowd was uproarious. The exhilaration had become
a kind of delirium. Men were losing their heads;
there was an element of irresponsibility in the new
outbreak likely to breed some violent act, which every
man of them would lament when sober again.</p>
<p>Nettlewood Foyle watched the dust rising from the
wheels of the stage, which had passed the elevator and
was nearing the Prairie Home Hotel, far down the street.
He would soon leave behind him this noisy ribaldry of
which he was the centre. He tossed his cheroot away.
Suddenly he heard a low voice behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you hit out, sergeant?&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>He started almost violently, and turned round. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
his face flushed, his eyes blurred with feeling and deep
surprise, and his lips parted in a whispered exclamation
and greeting.</p>
<p>A girl&#8217;s face from the shade of the sitting-room was
looking out at him, half smiling, but with heightened
color and a suppressed agitation. The girl was not
more than twenty-five, graceful, supple, and strong.
Her chin was dimpled; across her right temple was a
slight scar. She had eyes of a wonderful deep blue;
they seemed to swim with light. As Foyle gazed at her
for a moment dumfounded, with a quizzical suggestion
and smiling still a little more, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You used to be a little quicker, Nett.&#8221; The voice
appeared to attempt unconcern; but it quivered from a
force of feeling underneath. It was so long since she
had seen him.</p>
<p>He was about to reply, but, at the instant, a reveller
pushed him with a foot behind the knees so that they
were sprung forward. The crowd laughed&mdash;all save
Billy Goat, who knew his man.</p>
<p>Like lightning, and with cold fury in his eyes, Foyle
caught the tall cattleman by the forearm, and, with a
swift, dexterous twist, had the fellow in his power.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down&mdash;down to your knees, you skunk!&#8221; he said, in
a low, fierce voice.</p>
<p>The knees of the big man bent&mdash;Foyle had not taken
lessons of Ogami, the Jap, for nothing&mdash;they bent, and
the cattleman squealed, so intense was the pain. It
was break or bend; and he bent&mdash;to the ground and
lay there. Foyle stood over him for a moment, a hard
light in his eyes, and then, as if bethinking himself,
he looked at the other roisterers and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a limit, and he reached it. Your mouths are
your own, and you can blow off to suit your fancy, but
if any one thinks I&#8217;m a tame coyote to be poked with a
stick&mdash;!&#8221; He broke off, stooped over, and helped the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
man before him to his feet. The arm had been strained,
and the big fellow nursed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell, but you&#8217;re a twister!&#8221; the cattleman said, with
a grimace of pain.</p>
<p>Billy Goat was a gentleman, after his kind, and he
liked Sergeant Foyle with a great liking. He turned to
the crowd and spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, boys, this mine&#8217;s worked out. Let&#8217;s leave the
Happy Land to Foyle. Boys, what is he&mdash;what&mdash;is&mdash;he?
What&mdash;is&mdash;Sergeant Foyle&mdash;boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>The roar of the song they all knew came in reply, as
Billy Goat waved his arms about like the wild leader of
a wild orchestra:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Sergeant Foyle, oh, he&#8217;s a knocker from the West,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Foyle watched them go, dancing, stumbling, calling
back at him, as they moved toward the Prairie Home
Hotel:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;And he&#8217;ll soon&mdash;and he&#8217;ll soon&mdash;cinch you!&#8221;</p>

<p>His under-lip came out, his eyes half closed, as he
watched them. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done my last cinch. I&#8217;ve done
my last cinch,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, the look in his face changed, the eyes
swam as they had done a minute before at the sight of
the girl in the room behind. Whatever his trouble was,
that face had obscured it in a flash, and the pools of
feeling far down in the depths of a lonely nature had
been stirred. Recognition, memory, tenderness, desire
swam in his face, made generous and kind the hard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
lines of the strong mouth. In an instant he had swung
himself over the window-sill. The girl had drawn away
now into a more shaded corner of the room, and she
regarded him with a mingled anxiety and eagerness.
Was she afraid of something? Did she fear that&mdash;she
knew not quite what, but it had to do with a long ago?</p>
<p>&#8220;It was time you hit out, Nett,&#8221; she said, half shyly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re more patient than you used to be, but you&#8217;re
surer. My, that was a twist you gave him, Nett. Aren&#8217;t
you glad to see me?&#8221; she added, hastily and with an
effort to hide her agitation.</p>
<p>He reached out and took her hand with a strange
shyness and a self-consciousness which was alien to his
nature. The touch of her hand thrilled him. Their
eyes met. She dropped hers. Then he gathered himself
together. &#8220;Glad to see you? Of course, of course,
I&#8217;m glad. You stunned me, Jo. Why, do you know
where you are? You&#8217;re a thousand miles from home.
I can&#8217;t get it through my head, not really. What brings
you here? It&#8217;s ten years&mdash;ten years since I saw you,
and you were only fifteen, but a fifteen that was as
good as twenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>He scanned her face closely. &#8220;What&#8217;s that scar on
your forehead, Jo? You hadn&#8217;t that&mdash;then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran up against something,&#8221; she said, evasively, her
eyes glittering, &#8220;and it left that scar. Does it look so
bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;d never notice it, if you weren&#8217;t looking
close as I am. You see, I knew your face so well ten
years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head with a forced kind of smile. It
became him, however, for he smiled rarely; and the
smile was like a lantern turned on his face; it gave
light and warmth to its quiet strength&mdash;or hardness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were always quizzing,&#8221; she said, with an attempt
at a laugh&mdash;&#8220;always trying to find things out. That&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
why you made them reckon with you out here. You
always could see behind things; always would have your
own way; always were meant to be a success.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was beginning to get control of herself again, was
trying hard to keep things on the surface. &#8220;You were
meant to succeed&mdash;you had to,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a failure&mdash;a dead failure,&#8221; he answered,
slowly. &#8220;So they say. So they said. You heard them,
Jo.&#8221;</p>
<p>He jerked his head toward the open window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, those drunken fools!&#8221; she exclaimed, indignantly,
and her face hardened. &#8220;How I hate drink! It spoils
everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment. They were both
thinking of the same thing&mdash;<i>of the same man</i>. He repeated
a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;What brings you out here, Jo?&#8221; he asked, gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorland,&#8221; she answered, her face setting into determination
and anxiety.</p>
<p>His face became pinched. &#8220;Dorl!&#8221; he said, heavily.
&#8220;What for, Jo? What do you want with Dorl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Cynthy died she left her five hundred dollars
a year to the baby, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I know. Well, Jo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was all right for five years&mdash;Dorland paid
it in; but for five years he hasn&#8217;t paid anything. He&#8217;s
taken it, stolen it from his own child by his own honest
wife. I&#8217;ve come to get it&mdash;anyway, to stop him from
doing it any more. His own child&mdash;it puts murder in
my heart, Nett! I could kill him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded grimly. &#8220;That&#8217;s likely. And you&#8217;ve
kept Dorl&#8217;s child with your own money all these years?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got four hundred dollars a year, Nett, you know;
and I&#8217;ve been dressmaking&mdash;they say I&#8217;ve got taste,&#8221; she
added, with a whimsical smile.</p>
<p>Nett nodded his head. &#8220;Five years. That&#8217;s twenty-five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
hundred dollars he&#8217;s stolen from his own child. It&#8217;s
eight years old now, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bobby is eight and a half,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And his schooling, and his clothing, and everything;
and you have to pay for it all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind, Nett; it isn&#8217;t that. Bobby is
Cynthy&#8217;s child, and I love him&mdash;love him; but I want
him to have his rights. Dorl must give up his hold on
that money&mdash;or&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded gravely. &#8220;Or you&#8217;ll set the law on him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing or the other. Better to do it now
when Bobby is young and can&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or read the newspapers,&#8221; he commented, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve a hard heart,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;but
I&#8217;d like to punish him, if it wasn&#8217;t that he&#8217;s your brother,
Nett, and if it wasn&#8217;t for Bobby. Dorland was dreadfully
cruel, even to Cynthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know he was up here?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the lawyer that pays over the money. Dorland
has had it sent out here to Kowatin this two years.
And he sent word to the lawyer a month ago that he
wanted it to get here as usual. The letter left the same
day as I did, and it got here yesterday with me, I suppose.
He&#8217;ll be after it&mdash;perhaps to-day. He wouldn&#8217;t
let it wait long, Dorl wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foyle started. &#8220;To-day&mdash;to-day&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a gleam in his eyes, a setting of the lips,
a line sinking into the forehead between the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been watching for him all day, and I&#8217;ll watch
till he comes. I&#8217;m going to say some things to him
that he won&#8217;t forget. I&#8217;m going to get Bobby&#8217;s money,
or have the law to do it&mdash;unless you think I&#8217;m a brute,
Nett.&#8221; She looked at him wistfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. Don&#8217;t worry about me, Jo. He&#8217;s
my brother, but I know him&mdash;I know him through and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
through. He&#8217;s done everything that a man can do and
not be hanged. A thief, a drunkard, and a brute&mdash;and
he killed a man out here,&#8221; he added, hoarsely. &#8220;I found
it out myself&mdash;myself. It was murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, as he looked at her, an idea seemed to
flash into his mind. He came very near and looked at
her closely. Then he reached over and almost touched
the scar on her forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he do that, Jo?&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant she was silent and looked down at the
floor. Presently she raised her eyes, her face suffused.
Once or twice she tried to speak, but failed. At last
she gained courage, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;After Cynthy&#8217;s death I kept house for him for a
year, taking care of little Bobby. I loved Bobby so&mdash;he
has Cynthy&#8217;s eyes. One day Dorland&mdash;oh, Nett,
of course I oughtn&#8217;t to have stayed there&mdash;I know it
now; but I was only sixteen, and what did I understand!
And my mother was dead. One day&mdash;oh,
please, Nett, you can guess. He said something to me.
I made him leave the house. Before I could make
plans what to do, he came back mad with drink. I
went for Bobby, to get out of the house, but he caught
hold of me. I struck him in the face, and he threw
me against the edge of the open door. It made the
scar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foyle&#8217;s face was white. &#8220;Why did you never write
and tell me that, Jo? You know that I&mdash;&#8221; He stopped
suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had gone out of our lives down there. I didn&#8217;t
know where you were for a long time; and then&mdash;then
it was all right about Bobby and me, except that Bobby
didn&#8217;t get the money that was his. But now&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Foyle&#8217;s voice was hoarse and low. &#8220;He made that
scar, and he&mdash;and you only sixteen&mdash;Oh, my God!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly his face reddened, and he choked with shame
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
and anger. &#8220;And he&#8217;s my brother!&#8221; was all that he
could say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see him up here ever?&#8221; she asked, pityingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw him till a week ago.&#8221; A moment, then
he added, &#8220;The letter wasn&#8217;t to be sent here in his own
name, was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded. &#8220;Yes, in his own name, Dorland W.
Foyle. Didn&#8217;t he go by that name when you saw him?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an oppressive silence, in which she saw
that something moved him strangely, and then he answered,
&#8220;No, he was going by the name of Halbeck&mdash;Hiram
Halbeck.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl gasped. Then the whole thing burst upon
her. &#8220;Hiram Halbeck! Hiram Halbeck, the thief&mdash;I
read it all in the papers&mdash;the thief that you caught, and
that got away. And you&#8217;ve left the Mounted Police because
of it&mdash;oh, Nett!&#8221; Her eyes were full of tears, her
face was drawn and gray.</p>
<p>He nodded. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know who he was till I arrested
him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then, afterward, I thought of his
child, and let him get away; and for my poor old mother&#8217;s
sake. She never knew how bad he was, even as a boy.
But I remember how he used to steal and drink the
brandy from her bedside, when she had the fever. She
never knew the worst of him. But I let him away
in the night, Jo, and I resigned, and they thought
that Halbeck had beaten me, had escaped. Of course
I couldn&#8217;t stay in the Force, having done that. But, by
the heaven above us, if I had him here now I&#8217;d do the
thing&mdash;do it, so help me God!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you ruin your life for him?&#8221; she said,
with an outburst of indignation. All that was in her
heart welled up in her eyes at the thought of what
Foyle was. &#8220;You must not do it. You shall not do it.
<i>He</i> must pay for his wickedness, not you. It would be
a sin. You and what becomes of you mean so much.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
Suddenly, with a flash of purpose, she added, &#8220;He will
come for that letter, Nett. He would run any kind of
risk to get a dollar. He will come here for that letter&mdash;perhaps
to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head moodily, oppressed by the trouble
that was on him. &#8220;He&#8217;s not likely to venture here,
after what&#8217;s happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know him as well as I do, Nett. He is
so vain he&#8217;d do it, just to show that he could. He&#8217;d
probably come in the evening. Does any one know
him here? So many people pass through Kowatin
every day. Has any one seen him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Billy Goatry,&#8221; he answered, working his way
to a solution of the dark problem. &#8220;Only Billy Goatry
knows him. The fellow that led the singing&mdash;that was
Goatry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There he is now,&#8221; he added, as Billy Goat passed the
window.</p>
<p>She came and laid a hand on his arm. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got
to settle things with him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If Dorl comes,
Nett&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment, then he caught her
hand in his and held it. &#8220;If he comes, leave him to me,
Jo. You will leave him to me?&#8221; he added, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You&#8217;ll do what&#8217;s right&mdash;by
Bobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And by Dorl, too,&#8221; he replied, strangely.</p>
<p>There were loud footsteps without.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Goatry,&#8221; said Foyle. &#8220;You stay here. I&#8217;ll tell
him everything. He&#8217;s all right; he&#8217;s a true friend.
He&#8217;ll not interfere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The handle of the door turned slowly. &#8220;You keep
watch on the post-office, Jo,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Goatry came round the opening door with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope I don&#8217;t intrude,&#8221; he said, stealing a half-leering
look at the girl. As soon as he saw her face,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
however, he straightened himself up and took on different
manners. He had not been so intoxicated as he had
made out, and he seemed only &#8220;mellow&#8221; as he stood before
them, with his corrugated face and queer, quaint look,
the eye with the cast in it blinking faster than the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Goatry,&#8221; said Foyle. &#8220;This lady is
one of my family from the East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; on by stage?&#8221; Goatry said, vaguely, as they
shook hands.</p>
<p>She did not reply, for she was looking down the
street, and presently she started as she gazed. She
laid a hand suddenly on Foyle&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;See&mdash;he&#8217;s come,&#8221; she said, in a whisper, and as
though not realizing Goatry&#8217;s presence. &#8220;He&#8217;s come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goatry looked, as well as Foyle. &#8220;Halbeck&mdash;the
devil!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Foyle turned to him. &#8220;Stand by, Goatry. I want
you to keep a shut mouth. I&#8217;ve work to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goatry held out his hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m with you. If you
get him this time, clamp him, clamp him like a tooth in
a harrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halbeck had stopped his horse at the post-office door.
Dismounting, he looked quickly round, then drew the
reins over the horse&#8217;s head, letting them trail, as is the
custom of the West.</p>
<p>A few swift words passed between Goatry and Foyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do this myself, Jo,&#8221; he whispered to the girl
presently. &#8220;Go into another room. I&#8217;ll bring him here.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>In another minute Goatry was leading the horse
away from the post-office, while Foyle stood waiting
quietly at the door. The departing footsteps of the
horse brought Halbeck swiftly to the doorway, with a
letter in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, there, you damned sucker!&#8221; he called after
Goatry, and then saw Foyle waiting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell&mdash;!&#8221; he said, fiercely, his hand on
something in his hip-pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep quiet, Dorl. I want to have a little talk with
you. Take your hand away from that gun&mdash;take it
away!&#8221; he added, with a meaning not to be misunderstood.</p>
<p>Halbeck knew that one shout would have the town
on him, and he did not know what card his brother was
going to play. He let his arm drop to his side. &#8220;What&#8217;s
your game? What do you want?&#8221; he asked, surlily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over to the Happy Land Hotel,&#8221; Foyle answered,
and in the light of what was in his mind his words had
a grim irony.</p>
<p>With a snarl Halbeck stepped out. Goatry, who had
handed the horse over to the hostler, watched them coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did I never notice the likeness before?&#8221; Goatry
said to himself. &#8220;But, gosh! what a difference in the
men. Foyle&#8217;s going to double cinch him this time, I
guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>He followed them inside the hall of the Happy Land.
When they stepped into the sitting-room, he stood at
the door waiting. The hotel was entirely empty, the
roisterers at the Prairie Home having drawn off the
idlers and spectators. The barman was nodding behind
the bar, the proprietor was moving about in the backyard
inspecting a horse. There was a cheerful warmth
everywhere; the air was like an elixir; the pungent smell
of a pine-tree at the door gave a kind of medicament
to the indrawn breath. And to Billy Goat, who sometimes
sang in the choir of a church not a hundred miles
away&mdash;for the people agreed to forget his occasional
sprees&mdash;there came, he knew not why, the words of a
hymn he had sung only the preceding Sunday:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;As pants the hart for cooling streams,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>When heated in the chase&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>The words kept ringing in his ears as he listened to
the conversation inside the room&mdash;the partition was
thin, the door thinner, and he heard much. Foyle had
asked him not to intervene, but only to stand by and
await the issue of this final conference. He meant,
however, to take a hand in if he thought he was needed,
and he kept his ear glued to the door. If he thought
Foyle needed him&mdash;his fingers were on the handle of
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, hurry up! What do you want with me?&#8221;
asked Halbeck of his brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your time,&#8221; said ex-Sergeant Foyle, as he
drew the blind three-quarters down, so that they could
not be seen from the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a hurry, I tell you. I&#8217;ve got my plans. I&#8217;m
going South. I&#8217;ve only just time to catch the Canadian
Pacific three days from now, riding hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going South, Dorl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where am I going, then?&#8221; was the sneering reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not farther than the Happy Land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the devil&#8217;s all this? You don&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re
trying to arrest me again, after letting me go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to ask. You&#8217;re my prisoner.
You&#8217;re my prisoner,&#8221; he said, in a louder voice&mdash;&#8220;<i>until
you free yourself</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that damn quick, then,&#8221; said the other, his
hand flying to his hip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; was the sharp rejoinder, and a pistol was
in his face before he could draw his own weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your gun on the table,&#8221; Foyle said, quietly.
Halbeck did so. There was no other way.</p>
<p>Foyle drew it over to himself. His brother made a
motion to rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit still, Dorl,&#8221; came the warning voice.</p>
<p>White with rage, the freebooter sat still, his dissipated
face and heavy angry lips, looking like a debauched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
and villanous caricature of his brother before
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you&#8217;d have potted me, Dorl,&#8221; said
the ex-sergeant. &#8220;You&#8217;d have thought no more of doing
that than you did of killing Linley, the ranchman;
than you did of trying to ruin Jo Byndon, your wife&#8217;s
sister, when she was sixteen years old, when she was
caring for your child&mdash;giving her life for the child you
brought into the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the name of hell&mdash;it&#8217;s a lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bluster. I know the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you&mdash;the truth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did&mdash;to-day&mdash;an hour ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She here&mdash;out here?&#8221; There was a new, cowed note
in the voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is in the next room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did she come here for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To make you do right by your own child. I wonder
what a jury of decent men would think about a man
who robbed his child for five years, and let that child
be fed and clothed and cared for by the girl he tried
to destroy, the girl he taught what sin there was in the
world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She put you up to this. She was always in love
with you, and you know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a dangerous look in Foyle&#8217;s eyes, and his
jaw set hard. &#8220;There would be no shame in a decent
woman caring for me, even if it was true. I haven&#8217;t put
myself outside the boundary as you have. You&#8217;re my
brother, but you&#8217;re the worst scoundrel in the country&mdash;the
worst unhanged. Put on the table there the letter
in your pocket. It holds five hundred dollars belonging
to your child. There&#8217;s twenty-five hundred dollars
more to be accounted for.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other hesitated, then with an oath threw the
letter on the table. &#8220;I&#8217;ll pay the rest as soon as I can,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
if you&#8217;ll stop this damned tomfoolery,&#8221; he said, sullenly,
for he saw that he was in a hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll pay it, I suppose, out of what you stole from
the C. P. R. contractor&#8217;s chest. No, I don&#8217;t think that
will do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want me to go to prison, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. The truth would come out at the trial&mdash;the
whole truth&mdash;the murder and all. There&#8217;s your
child, Bobby. You&#8217;ve done him enough wrong already.
Do you want him&mdash;but it doesn&#8217;t matter whether you
do or not&mdash;do you want him to carry through life the
fact that his father was a jail-bird and a murderer, just
as Jo Byndon carries the scar you made when you
threw her against the door?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want with me, then?&#8221; The man
sank slowly and heavily back into the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a way&mdash;have you never thought of it?
When you threatened others as you did me, and life
seemed such a little thing in others&mdash;can&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bewildered, the man looked around helplessly. In
the silence which followed Foyle&#8217;s words his brain was
struggling to see a way out. Foyle&#8217;s further words
seemed to come from a great distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not too late to do the decent thing. You&#8217;ll
never repent of all you&#8217;ve done; you&#8217;ll never do different.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old, reckless, irresponsible spirit revived in the
man; he had both courage and bravado; he was not
hopeless yet of finding an escape from the net. He
would not beg, he would struggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lived as I meant to, and I&#8217;m not going to snivel
or repent now. It&#8217;s all a rotten business, anyhow,&#8221;
he rejoined.</p>
<p>With a sudden resolution the ex-sergeant put his own
pistol in his pocket, then pushed Halbeck&#8217;s pistol over
toward him on the table. Halbeck&#8217;s eyes lighted eagerly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
grew red with excitement, then a change passed over
them. They now settled on the pistol, and stayed.</p>
<p>He heard Foyle&#8217;s voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s with you to do what
you ought to do. Of course you can kill me. My
pistol&#8217;s in my pocket. But I don&#8217;t think you will.
You&#8217;ve murdered one man. You won&#8217;t load your soul
up with another. Besides, if you kill me, you will never
get away from Kowatin alive. But it&#8217;s with you&mdash;take
your choice. It&#8217;s me or you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halbeck&#8217;s fingers crept out and found the pistol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do your duty, Dorl,&#8221; said the ex-sergeant, as he
turned his back on his brother.</p>
<p>The door of the room opened, and Goatry stepped
inside softly. He had work to do, if need be, and his
face showed it. Halbeck did not see him.</p>
<p>There was a demon in Halbeck&#8217;s eyes, as his brother
stood, his back turned, taking his chances. A large
mirror hung on the wall opposite Halbeck. Goatry
was watching Halbeck&#8217;s face in the glass, and saw the
danger. He measured his distance.</p>
<p>All at once Halbeck caught Goatry&#8217;s face in the
mirror. The dark devilry faded out of his eyes. His
lips moved in a whispered oath. Every way was
blocked.</p>
<p>With a sudden wild resolution he raised the pistol to
his head. It cracked, and he fell back heavily in the
chair. There was a red trickle at the temple.</p>
<p>He had chosen the best way out.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had the pluck,&#8221; said Goatry, as Foyle swung
round with a face of misery.</p>
<p>A moment afterward came a rush of people. Goatry
kept them back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sergeant Foyle arrested Halbeck, and Halbeck&#8217;s shot
himself,&#8221; Goatry explained to them.</p>
<p>A white-faced girl with a scar on her temple made
her way into the room.</p>

<p>The harvest was all in, and, as far as eye could observe,
nothing remained of the golden sea of wheat which had
covered the wide prairie save the yellow stubble, the
bed of an ocean of wealth which had been gathered.
Here the yellow level was broken by a dark patch of
fallow land, there by a covert of trees also tinged with
yellow, or deepening to crimson and mauve&mdash;the harbinger
of autumn. The sun had not the insistent and
intensive strength of more southerly climes; it was
buoyant, confident, and heartening, and it shone in a
turquoise vault which covered and endeared the wide,
even world beneath. Now and then a flock of wild
ducks whirred past, making for the marshes or the innumerable
lakes that vitalized the expanse, or buzzards
hunched heavily along, frightened from some far resort
by eager sportsmen.</p>
<p>That was above; but beneath, on a level with the
unlifted eye, were houses here and there, looking in the
vastness like dolls&#8217; habitations. Many of the houses
stood blank and staring in the expanse, but some had
trees, and others little oases of green. Everywhere prosperity,
everywhere the strings of life pulled taut, signs
that energy had been straining on the leash.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>Yet there was one spot where it seemed that deadness
made encampment. It could not be seen in the
sweep of the eye, you must have travelled and looked
vigilantly to find it; but it was there&mdash;a lake shimmering
in the eager sun, washing against a reedy shore,
a little river running into the reedy lake at one end
and out at the other, a small, dilapidated house half hid
in a wood that stretched for half a mile or so upon a
rising ground. In front of the house, not far from the
lake, a man was lying asleep upon the ground, a rough
felt hat drawn over his eyes.</p>
<p>Like the house, the man seemed dilapidated also: a
slovenly, ill-dressed, demoralized figure he looked, even
with his face covered. He seemed in a deep sleep.
Wild ducks settled on the lake not far from him with
a swish and flutter; a coyote ran past, veering as it saw
the recumbent figure; a prairie hen rustled by with a
shrill cluck, but he seemed oblivious to all. If asleep,
he was evidently dreaming, for now and then he started,
or his body twitched and a muttering came from beneath
the hat.</p>
<p>The battered house, the absence of barn or stable or
garden, or any token of thrift or energy, marked the
man as an excrescence in this theatre of hope and fruitful
toil. It all belonged to some degenerate land, some
exhausted civilization, not to this field of vigor where
life rang like silver.</p>
<p>So the man lay for hour upon hour. He slept as
though he had been upon a long journey in which the
body was worn to helplessness. Or was it that sleep
of the worn-out spirit which, tortured by remembrance
and remorse, at last sinks into the depths where the
conscious vexes the unconscious&mdash;a little of fire, a little
of ice, and now and then the turn of the screw?</p>
<p>The day marched nobly on toward evening, growing
out of its blue and silver into a pervasive golden gleam;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
the bare, grayish houses on the prairie were transformed
into miniature palaces of light. Presently a girl came
out of the woods behind, looking at the neglected house
with a half-pitying curiosity. She carried in one hand
a fishing-rod which had been telescoped till it was no
bigger than a cane; in the other she carried a small
fishing-basket. Her father&#8217;s shooting and fishing camp
was a few miles away by a lake of greater size than this
which she approached. She had tired of the gay company
in camp, brought up for sport from beyond the
American border where she also belonged, and she had
come to explore the river running into this reedy lake.
She turned from the house and came nearer to the
lake, shaking her head, as though compassionating the
poor folk who lived there. She was beautiful. Her
hair was brown, going to tawny, but in this soft light
which enwrapped her she was in a sort of topaz flame.
As she came on, suddenly she stopped as though transfixed.
She saw the man&mdash;and saw also a tragedy afoot.</p>
<p>The man stirred violently in his sleep, cried out, and
started up. As he did so, a snake, disturbed in its
travel past him, suddenly raised itself in anger. Startled
out of sleep by some inner torture, the man heard the
sinister rattle he knew so well, and gazed paralyzed.</p>
<p>The girl had been but a few feet away when she first
saw the man and his angry foe. An instant, then, with
the instinct of the woods and the plains, and the courage
that has habitation everywhere, dropping her basket
she sprang forward noiselessly. The short, telescoped
fishing-rod she carried swung round her head and completed
its next half-circle at the head of the reptile,
even as it was about to strike. The blow was sure,
and with half-severed head the snake fell dead upon
the ground beside the man.</p>
<p>He was like one who has been projected from one
world to another, dazed, stricken, fearful. Presently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
the look of agonized dismay gave way to such an expression
of relief as might come upon the face of a
reprieved victim about to be given to the fire or to the
knife that flays. The place of dreams from which he
had emerged was like hell, and this was some world
of peace that he had not known these many years.
Always one had been at his elbow&mdash;&#8220;a familiar spirit
out of the ground&#8221;&mdash;whispering in his ear. He had
been down in the abysses of life.</p>
<p>He glanced again at the girl, and realized what she
had done: she had saved his life. Whether it had been
worth saving was another question; but he had been
near to the brink, had looked in, and the animal in him
had shrunk back from the precipice in a confused agony
of fear. He staggered to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; he said, pulling his coat
closer to hide the ragged waistcoat underneath, and
adjusting his worn and dirty hat&mdash;in his youth he had
been vain and ambitious, and good-looking also.</p>
<p>He asked his question in no impertinent tone, but in
the low voice of one who &#8220;shall whisper out of the dust.&#8221;
He had not yet recovered from the first impression of
his awakening, that the world in which he now stood was
not a real world.</p>
<p>She understood, and half in pity and half in conquered
repugnance said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I come from a camp beyond&#8221;&mdash;she indicated the
direction by a gesture. &#8220;I had been fishing&#8221;&mdash;she took
up the basket&mdash;&#8220;and chanced on you&mdash;then.&#8221; She
glanced at the snake significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You killed it in the nick of time,&#8221; he said, in a voice
that still spoke of the ground, but with a note of half-shamed
gratitude. &#8220;I want to thank you,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;You were brave. It would have turned on you if you
had missed. I know them. I&#8217;ve killed five.&#8221; He spoke
very slowly, huskily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are safe&mdash;that is the chief thing,&#8221; she
rejoined, making as though to depart. But presently she
turned back. &#8220;Why are you so dreadfully poor&mdash;and
everything?&#8221; she asked, gently.</p>
<p>His eye wandered over the lake and back again before
he answered her, in a dull, heavy tone, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had bad
luck, and, when you get down, there are plenty to kick
you farther.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t always poor as you are now&mdash;I mean
long ago, when you were young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so old,&#8221; he rejoined, sluggishly&mdash;&#8220;only
thirty-four.&#8221;</p>
<p>She could not suppress her astonishment. She looked
at the hair already gray, the hard, pinched face, the
lustreless eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet it must seem long to you,&#8221; she said, with
meaning.</p>
<p>Now he laughed&mdash;a laugh sodden and mirthless. He
was thinking of his boyhood. Everything, save one
or two spots all fire or all darkness, was dim in his debilitated
mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too far to go back,&#8221; he said, with a gleam of the
intelligence which had been strong in him once.</p>
<p>She caught the gleam. She had wisdom beyond her
years. It was the greater because her mother was dead,
and she had had so much wealth to dispense, for her
father was rich beyond counting, and she controlled his
household and helped to regulate his charities. She saw
that he was not of the laboring classes, that he had
known better days; his speech, if abrupt and cheerless,
was grammatical.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you cannot go back, you can go forward,&#8221; she
said, firmly. &#8220;Why should you be the only man in this
beautiful land who lives like this, who is idle when there
is so much to do, who sleeps in the daytime when there
is so much time to sleep at night?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></p>
<p>A faint flush came on the grayish, colorless face. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t sleep at night,&#8221; he returned, moodily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you sleep?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He did not answer, but stirred the body of the snake
with his foot. The tail moved; he stamped upon the
head with almost frenzied violence, out of keeping with
his sluggishness.</p>
<p>She turned away, yet looked back once more&mdash;she felt
tragedy around her. &#8220;It is never too late to mend,&#8221; she
said, and moved on, but stopped, for a young man came
running from the woods toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a hunt&mdash;such a hunt for you!&#8221; the young
man said, eagerly, then stopped short when he saw to
whom she had been talking. A look of disgust came
upon his face as he drew her away, his hand on her arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Heaven&#8217;s name, why did you talk to that man?&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You ought not to have trusted yourself near
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has he done?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Is he so bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about him. I inquired the other day.
He was once in a better position as a ranchman&mdash;ten
years ago; but he came into some money one day, and
he changed at once. He never had a good character;
even before he got his money he used to gamble, and
was getting a bad name. Afterward he began drinking,
and he took to gambling harder than ever. Presently
his money all went and he had to work; but his bad
habits had fastened on him, and now he lives from hand
to mouth, sometimes working for a month, sometimes
idle for months. There&#8217;s something sinister about him,
there&#8217;s some mystery; for poverty, or drink even&mdash;and
he doesn&#8217;t drink much now&mdash;couldn&#8217;t make him what he
is. He doesn&#8217;t seek company, and he walks sometimes
endless miles talking to himself, going as hard as he can.
How did you come to speak to him, Grace?&#8221;</p>
<p>She told him all, with a curious abstraction in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
voice, for she was thinking of the man from a standpoint
which her companion could not realize. She was
also trying to verify something in her memory. Ten
years ago, so her lover had just said, the poor wretch
behind them had been a different man; and there had
shot into her mind the face of a ranchman she had seen
with her father, the railway king, one evening when his
&#8220;special&#8221; had stopped at a railway station on his tour
through Montana&mdash;ten years ago. Why did the face of
the ranchman which had fixed itself on her memory then,
because he had come on the evening of her birthday and
had spoiled it for her, having taken her father away from
her for an hour&mdash;why did his face come to her now?
What had it to do with the face of this outcast she had
just left?</p>
<p>&#8220;What is his name?&#8221; she asked at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger Lygon,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger Lygon,&#8221; she repeated, mechanically. Something
in the man chained her thought&mdash;his face that
moment when her hand saved him and the awful fear
left him and a glimmer of light came into his eyes.</p>
<p>But her lover beside her broke into song. He was
happy with her. Everything was before him, her
beauty, her wealth, herself. He could not dwell upon
dismal things; his voice rang out on the sharp, sweet,
evening air:</p>

<p>Left alone, the man by the reedy lake stood watching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
them until they were out of view. The song came back
to him, echoing across the waters:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, come, let us camp on the North Trail together,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>The sunset glow, the girl&#8217;s presence, had given him
a moment&#8217;s illusion, had absorbed him for a moment,
acting on his deadened nature like a narcotic at once
soothing and stimulating. As some wild animal in a
forgotten land, coming upon ruins of a vast civilization,
towers, temples and palaces, in the golden glow of an
Eastern evening, stands abashed and vaguely wondering,
having neither reason to understand nor feeling
to enjoy, yet is arrested and abashed, so he stood.
He had lived the last three years so much alone, had
been cut off so completely from his kind&mdash;had lived
so much alone. Yet to-night, at last, he would not be
alone.</p>
<p>Some one was coming to-night, some one whom he
had not seen for a long time. Letters had passed, the
object of the visit had been defined, and he had spent
the intervening days since the last letter had arrived,
now agitated, now apathetic and sullen, now struggling
with some invisible being that kept whispering in his
ear, saying to him: &#8220;It was the price of fire and blood
and shame. You did it&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;you! You are
down, and you will never get up. You can only go
lower still&mdash;fire and blood and shame!&#8221;</p>
<p>Criminal as he was, he had never become hardened,
he had only become degraded. Crime was not his
vocation. He had no gift for it; still, the crime he had
committed had never been discovered&mdash;the crime that
he did with others. There were himself and Dupont
and another. Dupont was coming to-night&mdash;Dupont,
who had profited by the crime, and had not spent his
profits, but had built upon them to further profit; for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
Dupont was avaricious and prudent, and a born criminal.
Dupont had never had any compunctions or remorse, had
never lost a night&#8217;s sleep because of what they two had
done, instigated thereto by the other, who had paid them
so well for the dark thing.</p>
<p>The other was Henderley, the financier. He was
worse perhaps than Dupont, for he was in a different
sphere of life, was rich beyond counting, and had been
early nurtured in quiet Christian surroundings. The
spirit of ambition, rivalry, and the methods of a degenerate
and cruel finance had seized him, mastered
him; so that, under the cloak of power&mdash;as a toreador
hides the blade under the red cloth before his enemy the
<i>toro</i>&mdash;he held a sword of capital which did cruel and
vicious things, at last becoming criminal also. Henderley
had incited and paid; the others, Dupont and
Lygon, had acted and received. Henderley had had no
remorse, none at any rate that weighed upon him, for
he had got used to ruining rivals and seeing strong men
go down, and those who had fought him come to beg
or borrow of him in the end. He had seen more than
one commit suicide, and those they loved go down and
farther down, and he had helped these up a little, but
not near enough to put them near his own plane again;
and he could not see&mdash;it never occurred to him&mdash;that he
had done any evil to them. Dupont thought upon his
crimes now and then, and his heart hardened, for he
had no moral feeling; Henderley did not think at all.
It was left to the man of the reedy lake to pay the
penalty of apprehension, to suffer the effects of crime
upon a nature not naturally criminal.</p>
<p>Again and again, how many hundreds of times, had
Roger Lygon seen in his sleep&mdash;had even seen awake,
so did hallucination possess him&mdash;the new cattle trail
he had fired for scores of miles. The fire had destroyed
the grass over millions of acres, two houses had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
burned and three people had lost their lives; all to satisfy
the savage desire of one man, to destroy the chance of
a cattle trade over a great section of country for the
railway which was to compete with his own&mdash;an act
which, in the end, was futile, failed of its purpose.
Dupont and Lygon had been paid their price, and had
disappeared and been forgotten&mdash;they were but pawns
in his game&mdash;and there was no proof against Henderley.
Henderley had forgotten. Lygon wished to forget, but
Dupont remembered, and meant now to reap fresh profit
by the remembrance.</p>
<p>Dupont was coming to-night, and the hatchet of
crime was to be dug up again. So it had been
planned.</p>
<p>As the shadows fell, Lygon roused himself from his
trance with a shiver. It was not cold, but in him there
was a nervous agitation, making him cold from head to
foot; his body seemed as impoverished as his mind.
Looking with heavy-lidded eyes across the prairie, he
saw in the distance the barracks of the Riders of the
Plains and the jail near by, and his shuddering ceased.
There was where he belonged, within four stone walls;
yet here he was free to go where he willed, to live as
he willed, with no eye upon him. With no eye upon
him? There was no eye, but there was the Whisperer
whom he could never drive away. Morning and night
he heard the words: &#8220;You&mdash;you&mdash;you! Fire and blood
and shame!&#8221; He had snatched sleep when he could
find it, after long, long hours of tramping over the
plains, ostensibly to shoot wild fowl, but in truth to
bring on a great bodily fatigue&mdash;and sleep. His sleep
only came then in the first watches of the night. As
the night wore on the Whisperer began again, as the
cloud of weariness lifted a little from him and the senses
were released from the heavy sedative of unnatural exertion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>The dusk deepened. The moon slowly rose. He
cooked his scanty meal and took a deep draught from
a horn of whiskey from beneath a board in the flooring.
He had not the courage to face Dupont without it, nor
yet to forget what he must forget if he was to do the
work Dupont came to arrange&mdash;he must forget the girl
who had saved his life and the influence of those strange
moments in which she had spoken down to him, in the
abyss where he had been lying.</p>
<p>He sat in the doorway, a fire gleaming behind
him; he drank in the good air as though his lungs were
thirsty for it, and saw the silver glitter of the moon
upon the water. Not a breath of wind stirred, and the
shining path the moon made upon the reedy lake
fascinated his eye. Everything was so still except
that whisper, louder in his ear than it had ever been
before.</p>
<p>Suddenly, upon the silver path upon the lake there
shot a silent canoe, with a figure as silently paddling
toward him. He gazed for a moment dismayed, and
then got to his feet with a jerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dupont,&#8221; he said, mechanically.</p>
<p>The canoe swished among the reeds and rushes,
scraped on the shore, and a tall, burly figure sprang
from it and stood still, looking at the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Qui reste là</i>&mdash;Lygon?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dupont,&#8221; was the nervous, hesitating reply.</p>
<p>Dupont came forward quickly. &#8220;<i>Ah</i>, <i>ben</i>, here we are
again&mdash;so,&#8221; he grunted, cheerily.</p>
<p>Entering the house, they sat before the fire, holding
their hands to the warmth from force of habit, though
the night was not cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ben</i>, you will do it to-night&mdash;then?&#8221; Dupont said.
&#8220;<i>Sacré</i>, it is time!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221; rejoined the other, heavily.</p>
<p>An angry light leaped into Dupont&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;You not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
unnerstan&#8217; my letters&mdash;bah! You know it all right, so
queeck.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other remained silent, staring into the fire with
wide, searching eyes.</p>
<p>Dupont put a hand on him. &#8220;You ketch my idee
queeck. We mus&#8217; have more money from that Henderley&mdash;certainlee.
It is ten years, and he t&#8217;ink it is
all right. He t&#8217;ink we come no more becos&#8217; he give
five t&#8217;ousand dollars to us each. That was to do the
t&#8217;ing, to fire the country. Now we want another ten
t&#8217;ousan&#8217; to us each, to forget we do it for him&mdash;<i>hein</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still there was no reply. Dupont went on, watching
the other furtively, for he did not like this silence. But
he would not resent it till he was sure there was good
cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;It comes to suit us. He is over there at the Old
Man Lak&#8217;, where you can get at him easy, not like
in the city where he lif&#8217;. Over in the States, he laugh
mebbe, becos&#8217; he is at home, an&#8217; can buy off the law.
But here&mdash;it is Canadaw, an&#8217; they not care eef he have
hunder&#8217; meellion dollar. He know that&mdash;sure. Eef you
say you not care a dam to go to jail, so you can put him
there, too, becos&#8217; you have not&#8217;ing, an&#8217; so dam seeck
of everyt&#8217;ing, he will t&#8217;ink ten t&#8217;ousan&#8217; dollar same as one
cent to Nic Dupont&mdash;<i>ben sûr</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lygon nodded his head, still holding his hands to the
blaze. With ten thousand dollars he could get away
into&mdash;into another world somewhere, some world where
he could forget, as he forgot for a moment this afternoon
when the girl said to him, &#8220;It is never too late to mend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, as he thought of her, he pulled his coat together
and arranged the rough scarf at his neck involuntarily.
Ten thousand dollars&mdash;but ten thousand dollars
by blackmail, hush-money, the reward of fire and blood
and shame! Was it to go on? Was he to commit a
new crime?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></p>
<p>He stirred, as though to shake off the net that he felt
twisting round him, in the hands of the robust and
powerful Dupont, on whom crime sat so lightly, who
had flourished while he, Lygon, had gone lower and
lower. Ten years ago he had been the better man, had
taken the lead, was the master, Dupont the obedient
confederate, the tool. Now, Dupont, once the rough
river-driver, grown prosperous in a large way for him&mdash;who
might yet be mayor of his town in Quebec&mdash;he
held the rod of rule. Lygon was conscious that the
fifty dollars sent him every New Year for five years by
Dupont had been sent with a purpose, and that he was
now Dupont&#8217;s tool. Debilitated, demoralized, how could
he, even if he wished, struggle against this powerful
confederate, as powerful in will as in body? Yet if he
had his own way he would not go to Henderley. He
had lived with a &#8220;familiar spirit&#8221; so long, he feared
the issue of this next excursion into the fens of crime.</p>
<p>Dupont was on his feet now. &#8220;He will be here only
three days more&mdash;I haf find it so. To-night it mus&#8217; be
done. As we go I will tell you what to say. I will
wait at the Forks, an&#8217; we will come back togedder.
His check will do. Eef he gif at all, the check is all
right. He will not stop it. Eef he have the money, it is
better&mdash;<i>sacré</i>&mdash;yes. Eef he not gif&mdash;well, I will tell you,
there is the other railway man he try to hurt, how would
he like&mdash;But I will tell you on the river. <i>Maint&#8217;nant</i>&mdash;queeck,
we go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word Lygon took down another coat and
put it on. Doing so he concealed a weapon quickly,
as Dupont stooped to pick a coal for his pipe from the
blaze. Lygon had no fixed purpose in taking a weapon
with him; it was only a vague instinct of caution that
moved him.</p>
<p>In the canoe on the river, in an almost speechless
apathy, he heard Dupont&#8217;s voice giving him instructions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></p>
<p>Henderley, the financier, had just finished his game of
whist and dismissed his friends&mdash;it was equivalent to
dismissal, rough yet genial as he seemed to be, so did
immense wealth and its accompanying power affect his
relations with those about him. In everything he was
&#8220;considered.&#8221; He was in good-humor, for he had won
all the evening, and with a smile he rubbed his hands
among the notes&mdash;three thousand dollars it was. It
was like a man with a pocketful of money chuckling
over a coin he had found in the street. Presently he
heard a rustle of the inner tent-curtain and swung
round. He faced the man from the reedy lake.</p>
<p>Instinctively he glanced round for a weapon, mechanically
his hands firmly grasped the chair in front of him.
He had been in danger of his life many times, and he
had no fear. He had been threatened with assassination
more than once, and he had got used to the idea of
danger; life to him was only a game.</p>
<p>He kept his nerve; he did not call out; he looked his
visitor in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here? Who are you?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221; answered Lygon, gazing intently
at him.</p>
<p>Face to face with the man who had tempted him to
crime, Lygon had a new sense of boldness, a sudden
feeling of reprisal, a rushing desire to put the screw upon
him. At sight of this millionaire with the pile of notes
before him there vanished the sickening hesitation of
the afternoon, of the journey with Dupont. The look
of the robust, healthy financier was like acid in a wound;
it maddened him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will know me better soon,&#8221; Lygon added, his
head twitching with excitement.</p>
<p>Henderley recognized him now. He gripped the armchair
spasmodically, but presently regained a complete
composure. He knew the game that was forward here,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
and he also thought that if once he yielded to blackmail
there would never be an end to it. He made no pretence,
but came straight to the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do nothing; there is no proof,&#8221; he said,
with firm assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is Dupont,&#8221; answered Lygon, doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Dupont?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The French Canadian who helped me&mdash;I divided
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said the man who helped you died. You wrote
that to me. I suppose you are lying now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Henderley coolly straightened the notes on the table,
smoothing out the wrinkles, arranging them according
to their denominations with an apparently interested
eye; yet he was vigilantly watching the outcast before
him. To yield to blackmail would be fatal; not to yield
to it&mdash;he could not see his way. He had long ago forgotten
the fire and blood and shame. No Whisperer
reminded him of that black page in the history of his
life; he had been immune of conscience. He could not
understand this man before him. It was as bad a case
of human degradation as ever he had seen&mdash;he remembered
the stalwart, if dissipated, ranchman who
had acted on his instigation. He knew now that he
had made a foolish blunder then, that the scheme had
been one of his failures; but he had never looked on it
as with eyes reproving crime. As a hundred thoughts
tending toward the solution of the problem by which
he was faced flashed through his mind, and he rejected
them all, he repeated mechanically the phrase &#8220;I suppose
you are lying now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dupont is here&mdash;not a mile away,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;He will give proof. He would go to jail or to the
gallows to put you there, if you do not pay. He is a
devil&mdash;Dupont.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still the great man could not see his way out. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
must temporize for a little longer, for rashness might
bring scandal or noise; and near by was his daughter,
the apple of his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want? How much did you figure you
could get out of me, if I let you bleed me?&#8221; he asked,
sneeringly and coolly. &#8220;Come now, how much?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lygon, in whom a blind hatred of the man still raged,
was about to reply, when he heard a voice calling,
&#8220;Daddy, Daddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the red, half-insane light died down in
Lygon&#8217;s eyes. He saw the snake upon the ground by
the reedy lake, the girl standing over it&mdash;the girl with
the tawny hair. This was her voice.</p>
<p>Henderley had made a step toward a curtain opening
into another room of the great tent, but before he could
reach it the curtain was pushed back and the girl entered
with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come in?&#8221; she said; then stood still, astonished,
seeing Lygon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Oh&mdash;you!&#8221;</p>
<p>All at once a look came into her face which stirred it
as a flying insect stirs the water of a pool. On the
instant she remembered that she had seen the man
before.</p>
<p>It was ten years ago in Montana, on the night of her
birthday. Her father had been called away to talk with
this man, and she had seen him from the steps of the
&#8220;special.&#8221; It was only the caricature of the once strong,
erect ranchman that she saw; but there was no mistake,
she recognized him now.</p>
<p>Lygon, dumfounded, looked from her to her father,
and he saw now in Henderley&#8217;s eyes a fear that was not
to be misunderstood.</p>
<p>Here was where Henderley could be smitten, could
be brought to his knees. It was the vulnerable part of
him. Lygon could see that he was stunned. The great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
financier was in his power. He looked back again to
the girl, and her face was full of trouble.</p>
<p>A sharp suspicion was in her heart that somehow or
other her father was responsible for this man&#8217;s degradation
and ruin. She looked Lygon in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you want to see me?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>She scarcely knew why she said it; but she was sensible
of trouble, maybe of tragedy, somewhere; and she had
a vague dread of she knew not what, for, hide it, avoid it,
as she had done so often, there was in her heart an unhappy
doubt concerning her father.</p>
<p>A great change had come over Lygon. Her presence
had altered him. He was again where she had left him
in the afternoon.</p>
<p>He heard her say to her father: &#8220;This was the man
I told you of&mdash;at the reedy lake. Did you come to see
me?&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not know you were here,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I
came&#8221;&mdash;he was conscious of Henderley&#8217;s staring eyes
fixed upon his helplessly&mdash;&#8220;I came to ask your father if
he would not buy my shack. There is good shooting at
the lake; the ducks come plenty, sometimes. I want
to get away, to start again somewhere. I&#8217;ve been a
failure. I want to get away, right away south. If he
would buy it, I could start again. I&#8217;ve had no luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had invented it on the moment, but the girl
understood better than Lygon or Henderley could have
dreamed. She had seen the change pass over Lygon.</p>
<p>Henderley had a hand on himself again, and the
startled look went out of his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want for your shack and the lake?&#8221; he
asked, with restored confidence. The fellow no doubt
was grateful that his daughter had saved his life, he
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred dollars,&#8221; answered Lygon, quickly.</p>
<p>Henderley would have handed over all that lay on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
the table before him, but he thought it better not to
do so. &#8220;I&#8217;ll buy it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You seem to have
been hit hard. Here is the money. Bring me the
deed to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not take the money till I give you the deed,&#8221;
said Lygon. &#8220;It will do to-morrow. It&#8217;s doing me a
good turn. I&#8217;ll get away and start again somewhere.
I&#8217;ve done no good up here. Thank you, sir&mdash;thank
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before they realized it, the tent-curtain rose and fell,
and he was gone into the night.</p>
<p>The trouble was still deep in the girl&#8217;s eyes as she
kissed her father, and he, with an overdone cheerfulness,
wished her a good-night.</p>
<p>The man of iron had been changed into a man of
straw once at least in his lifetime.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Lygon found Dupont at the Forks.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Eh</i>, <i>ben</i>, it is all right&mdash;yes?&#8221; Dupont asked, eagerly,
as Lygon joined him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is all right,&#8221; answered Lygon.</p>
<p>With an exulting laugh and an obscene oath, Dupont
pushed out the canoe, and they got away into the moonlight.
No word was spoken for some distance, but Dupont
kept giving grunts of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got the ten t&#8217;ousan&#8217; each&mdash;in cash or check,
eh? The check or the money&mdash;<i>hein</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got nothing,&#8221; answered Lygon.</p>
<p>Dupont dropped his paddle with a curse.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got not&#8217;ing! You said eet was all right!&#8221; he
growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all right. I got nothing. I asked for nothing.
I have had enough. I have finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a roar of rage Dupont sprang on him, and caught
him by the throat as the canoe swayed and dipped.
He was blind with fury.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<p>Lygon tried with one hand for his knife, and got it,
but the pressure on his throat was growing terrible.</p>
<p>For minutes the struggle continued, for Lygon was
fighting with the desperation of one who makes his last
awful onset against fate and doom.</p>
<p>Dupont also had his knife at work. At last it drank
blood, but as he got it home he suddenly reeled blindly,
lost his balance, and lurched into the water with a
groan.</p>
<p>Lygon, weapon in hand and bleeding freely, waited
for him to rise and make for the canoe again.</p>
<p>Ten, twenty, fifty seconds passed. Dupont did not
rise. A minute went by, and still there was no stir, no
sign. Dupont would never rise again. In his wild rage
he had burst a blood-vessel on the brain.</p>
<p>Lygon bound up his reeking wound as best he could.
He did it calmly, whispering to himself the while.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must do it. I must get there if I can. I will not
be afraid to die then,&#8221; he muttered to himself.</p>
<p>Presently he grasped an oar and paddled feebly.</p>
<p>A slight wind had risen, and, as he turned the boat in
to face the Forks again, it helped to carry the canoe to
the landing-place.</p>
<p>Lygon dragged himself out. He did not try to draw
the canoe up, but began this journey of a mile back to
the tent he had left so recently. First, step by step,
leaning against trees, drawing himself forward, a journey
as long to his determined mind as from youth to age.
Would it never end? It seemed a terrible climbing-up
the sides of a cliff, and, as he struggled fainting on, all
sorts of sounds were in his ears, but he realized that the
Whisperer was no longer there. The sounds he heard
did not torture, they helped his stumbling feet. They
were like the murmur of waters, like the sounds of the
forest and soft, booming bells. But the bells were only
the beatings of his heart&mdash;so loud, so swift.</p>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>He was on his knees now, crawling on&mdash;on&mdash;on. At
last there came a light, suddenly bursting on him from
a tent he was so near. Then he called, and called
again, and fell forward on his face. But now he heard
a voice above him. It was <i>her</i> voice. He had blindly
struggled on to die near her, near where she was, she
was so pitiful and good.</p>
<p>He had accomplished his journey, and her voice was
speaking above him. There were other voices, but it
was only hers that he heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;God help him&mdash;oh, God help him!&#8221; she was saying.</p>
<p>He drew a long, quiet breath. &#8220;I will sleep now,&#8221; he
said, clearly.</p>
<p>He would hear the Whisperer no more.</p>

<h2>AS DEEP AS THE SEA</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What can I do, Dan? I&#8217;m broke, too. My last
dollar went to pay my last debt to-day. I&#8217;ve nothing
but what I stand in. I&#8217;ve got prospects, but I can&#8217;t
discount prospects at the banks.&#8221; The speaker laughed
bitterly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve reaped and I&#8217;m sowing, the same as
you, Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other made a nervous motion of protest. &#8220;No;
not the same as me, Flood&mdash;not the same. It&#8217;s sink
or swim with me, and if you can&#8217;t help me&mdash;oh, I&#8217;d
take my gruel without whining, if it wasn&#8217;t for Di!
It&#8217;s that that knocks me over. It&#8217;s the shame to her.
Oh, what a cursed ass and fool&mdash;and thief, I&#8217;ve been!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thief?&mdash;thief?&#8221;</p>
<p>Flood Rawley dropped the flaming match with which
he was about to light a cheroot, and stood staring, his
dark-blue eyes growing wider, his worn, handsome face
becoming drawn, as swift conviction mastered him.
He felt that the black words which had fallen from his
friend&#8217;s lips&mdash;from the lips of Diana Welldon&#8217;s brother&mdash;were
the truth. He looked at the plump face, the
full, amiable eyes, now misty with fright, at the characterless
hand nervously feeling the golden mustache,
at the well-fed, inert body; and he knew that, whatever
the trouble or the peril, Dan Welldon could not surmount
it alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Rawley asked, rather sharply, his fingers
running through his slightly grizzled black hair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
but not excitedly, for he wanted no scenes; and if this
thing could hurt Di Welldon, and action was necessary,
he must remain cool. What she was to do, Heaven and
he only knew; what she had done for him, perhaps
neither understood fully as yet. &#8220;What is it&mdash;quick?&#8221;
he added, and his words were like a sharp grip upon Dan
Welldon&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Racing?&mdash;cards?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan nodded. &#8220;Yes, over at Askatoon; five hundred
on Jibway, the favorite&mdash;he fell at the last fence; five
hundred at poker with Nick Fison; and a thousand
in land speculation at Edmonton, on margin. Everything
went wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you put your hand in the railway company&#8217;s
money-chest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed such a dead certainty&mdash;Jibway; and the
Edmonton corner-blocks, too. I&#8217;d had luck with Nick
before; but&mdash;well, there it is, Flood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They know&mdash;the railway people&mdash;Shaughnessy
knows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the president knows. He&#8217;s at Calgary now.
They telegraphed him, and he wired to give me till
midnight to pay up or go to jail. They&#8217;re watching
me now. I can&#8217;t stir. There&#8217;s no escape, and there&#8217;s
no one I can ask for help but you. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve
come, Flood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, what a fool! Couldn&#8217;t you see what the end
would be if your plunging didn&#8217;t come off? You&mdash;you
oughtn&#8217;t to bet, or speculate, or play cards, you&#8217;re
not clever enough. You&#8217;ve got blind rashness, and so
you think you&#8217;re bold. And Di&mdash;oh, you idiot! And
on a salary of a thousand dollars a year!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Di would help me; but I couldn&#8217;t explain.&#8221;
The weak face puckered, a lifeless kind of tear gathered
in the ox-like eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she probably would help you. She&#8217;d probably
give you all she&#8217;s saved to go to Europe with and study,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
saved from her pictures sold at twenty per cent. of
their value; and she&#8217;d mortgage the little income she&#8217;s
got to keep her brother out of jail. Of course she would,
and of course you ought to be ashamed of yourself for
thinking of it.&#8221; Rawley lighted his cigar and smoked
fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be better for her than my going to jail,&#8221;
stubbornly replied the other. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to
tell her, or to ask her for money. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve
come to you. You needn&#8217;t be so hard, Flood; you&#8217;ve
not been a saint; and Di knows it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rawley took the cheroot from his mouth, threw back
his head, and laughed mirthlessly, ironically. Then
suddenly he stopped and looked round the room till
his eyes rested on a portrait-drawing which hung on
the wall opposite the window, through which the sun
poured. It was the face of a girl with beautiful bronzed
hair, and full, fine, beautifully modelled face, with brown
eyes deep and brooding, which seemed to have time
and space behind them&mdash;not before them. The lips
were delicate and full, and had the look suggesting a
smile which the inward thought has stayed. It was
like one of the Titian women&mdash;like a Titian that hangs
on the wall of the Gallery at Munich. The head and
neck, the whole personality, had an air of distinction
and destiny. The drawing had been done by a wandering
duchess who had seen the girl sketching in the foothills
when on a visit to that &#8220;Wild West&#8221; which has
such power to refine and inspire minds not superior
to Nature. Its replica was carried to a castle in Scotland.
It had been the gift of Diana Welldon on a
certain day not long ago, when Flood Rawley had made
a pledge to her, which was as vital to him and to his
future as two thousand dollars were vital to Dan Welldon
now.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve not been a saint, and Di knows it,&#8221; repeated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
the weak brother of a girl whose fame belonged to the
West; whose name was a signal for cheerful looks; whose
buoyant humor and impartial friendliness gained her
innumerable friends; and whose talent, understood by
few, gave her a certain protection, lifting her a little
away from the outwardly crude and provincial life
around her.</p>
<p>When Rawley spoke, it was with quiet deliberation,
and even gentleness. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been a saint, and she
knows it, as you say, Dan; but the law is on my side
as yet, it isn&#8217;t on yours. There&#8217;s the difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You used to gamble yourself; you were pretty tough,
and you oughtn&#8217;t to walk up my back with hobnailed
boots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I gambled, Dan, and I drank, and I raised a
dust out here. My record was writ pretty big. But I
didn&#8217;t lay my hands on the ark of the social covenant,
whose inscription is, <i>Thou shalt not steal</i>; and that&#8217;s why
I&#8217;m poor but proud, and no one&#8217;s watching for me round
the corner, same as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Welldon&#8217;s half-defiant petulance disappeared. &#8220;What&#8217;s
done can&#8217;t be undone.&#8221; Then, with a sudden burst of
anguish, &#8220;Oh, get me out of this somehow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How? I&#8217;ve got no money. By speaking to your
sister?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I do it?&#8221; Rawley peered anxiously into the
other&#8217;s face, and he knew that there was no real security
against the shameful trouble being laid bare to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a chance to start straight again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice was fluttered, almost whining; it carried
no conviction; but the words had in them a reminder
of words that Rawley himself had said to Diana Welldon
but a few months ago, and a new spirit stirred in him.
He stepped forward and, gripping Dan&#8217;s shoulder with
a hand of steel, said, fiercely:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dan. I&#8217;d rather take you to her in your coffin.
She&#8217;s never known you, never seen what most of us
have seen, that all you have&mdash;or nearly all&mdash;is your
lovely looks and what they call a kind heart. There&#8217;s
only you two in your family, and she&#8217;s got to live with
you&mdash;awhile, anyhow. She couldn&#8217;t stand this business.
She mustn&#8217;t stand it. She&#8217;s had enough to put up
with in me; but at the worst she could pass me by on the
other side, and there would be an end. It would have
been said that Flood Rawley had got his deserts. It&#8217;s
different with you.&#8221; His voice changed, softened.
&#8220;Dan, I made a pledge to her that I&#8217;d never play cards
again for money while I lived, and it wasn&#8217;t a thing
to take on without some cogitation. But I cogitated,
and took it on, and started life over again&mdash;me! Began
practising law again&mdash;barrister, solicitor, notary public&mdash;at
forty. And at last I&#8217;ve got my chance in a big
case against the Canadian Pacific. It&#8217;ll make me or
break me, Dan.... There, I wanted you to see where I
stand with Di; and now I want you to promise me that
you&#8217;ll not leave these rooms till I see you again. I&#8217;ll
get you clear; I&#8217;ll save you, Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flood! Oh, my God, Flood!&#8221; The voice was
broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to stay here, and you&#8217;re to remember
not to get the funk, even if I don&#8217;t come before midnight.
I&#8217;ll be here then, if I&#8217;m alive. If you don&#8217;t keep your
word&mdash;but, there, you will.&#8221; Both hands gripped the
graceful shoulders of the miscreant like a vise.</p>
<p>&#8220;So help me, Flood,&#8221; was the frightened, whispered
reply. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make it up to you somehow, some day. I&#8217;ll
pay you back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rawley caught up his cap from the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady!&mdash;steady! Don&#8217;t go at a fence till you&#8217;re
sure of your seat, Dan,&#8221; he said. Then, with a long
look at the portrait on the wall and an exclamation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
which the other did not hear, he left the room with a
set, determined face.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Who told you? What brought you, Flood?&#8221; the
girl asked, her chin in her long, white hands, her head
turned from the easel to him, a book in her lap, the sun
breaking through the leaves upon her hat, touching the
Titian hair with splendor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fate brought me, and didn&#8217;t tell me,&#8221; he answered,
with a whimsical quirk of the mouth and his trouble
lurking behind the sea-deep eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you have come if you knew I was here?&#8221;
she urged, archly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for two thousand dollars,&#8221; he answered, the
look of trouble deepening in his eyes, but his lips were
smiling. He had a quaint sense of humor, and at his
last gasp would have noted the ridiculous thing. And
surely it was a droll malignity of Fate to bring him
here to her whom, in this moment of all moments in
his life, he wished far away. Fate meant to try him to
the uttermost. This hurdle of trial was high, indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thousand dollars&mdash;nothing less?&#8221; she inquired,
gayly. &#8220;You are too specific for a real lover.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fate fixed the amount,&#8221; he added, dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fate&mdash;you talk so much of Fate,&#8221; she replied, gravely,
and her eyes looked into the distance. &#8220;You make
me think of it, too, and I don&#8217;t want to do so. I don&#8217;t
want to feel helpless, to be the child of Accident and
Destiny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you get the same thing in the &#8216;fore-ordination&#8217;
that old Minister M&#8217;Gregor preaches every Sunday.
&#8216;Be elect or be damned,&#8217; he says to us all. Names
aren&#8217;t important; but, anyhow, it was Fate that led me
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure it wasn&#8217;t me?&#8221; she asked, softly. &#8220;Are
you sure I wasn&#8217;t calling you, and you had to come?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was <i>en route</i>, anyhow; and you are always
calling, if I must tell you,&#8221; he laughed. Suddenly he
became grave. &#8220;I hear you call me in the night sometimes,
and I start up and say &#8216;Yes, Di!&#8217; out of my sleep.
It&#8217;s a queer hallucination. I&#8217;ve got you on the brain,
certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to vex you&mdash;certainly,&#8221; she said, opening
the book that lay in her lap, &#8220;and your eyes trouble me
to-day. They&#8217;ve got a look that used to be in them,
Flood, before&mdash;before you promised; and another look
I don&#8217;t understand and don&#8217;t like. I suppose it&#8217;s always
so. The real business of life is trying to understand
each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have wonderful thoughts for one that&#8217;s had so
little chance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s because you&#8217;re a genius,
I suppose. Teaching can&#8217;t give that sort of thing&mdash;the
insight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Flood?&#8221; she asked, suddenly,
again, her breast heaving, her delicate, rounded fingers
interlacing. &#8220;I heard a man say once that you were &#8216;as
deep as the sea.&#8217; He did not mean it kindly, but I do.
You are in trouble, and I want to share it if I can.
Where were you going when you came across me here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To see old Busby, the quack-doctor up there,&#8221; he
answered, nodding toward a shrubbed and wooded
hillock behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Busby!&#8221; she rejoined, in amazement. &#8220;What
do you want with him&mdash;not medicine of that old quack,
that dreadful man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He cures people sometimes. A good many out here
owe him more than they&#8217;ll ever pay him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he as rich an old miser as they say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t look rich, does he?&#8221; was the enigmatical
answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does any one know his real history? He didn&#8217;t
come from nowhere. He must have had friends once.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
Some one must once have cared for him, though he
seems such a monster now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet he cures people sometimes,&#8221; he rejoined, abstractedly.
&#8220;Probably there&#8217;s some good underneath.
I&#8217;m going to try and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? What is your business with him?
Won&#8217;t you tell me? Is it so secret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want him to help me in a case I&#8217;ve got in hand.
A client of mine is in trouble&mdash;you mustn&#8217;t ask about
it; and he can help, I think&mdash;I think so.&#8221; He got to
his feet. &#8220;I must be going, Di,&#8221; he added. Suddenly
a flush swept over his face, and he reached out and
took both her hands. &#8220;Oh, you are a million times too
good for me!&#8221; he said. &#8220;But if all goes well, I&#8217;ll do my
best to make you forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait&mdash;wait one moment,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Before
you go I want you to hear what I&#8217;ve been reading over
and over to myself just now. It is from a book I got
from Quebec, called <i>When Time Shall Pass</i>. It is a
story of two like you and me. The man is writing to
the woman, and it has things that you have said to me&mdash;in
a different way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t talk like a book, but I know a star in a
dark night when I see it,&#8221; he answered, with a catch in
his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she said, catching his hand in hers as she
read, while all around them the sounds of summer&mdash;the
distant clack of a reaper, the crack of a whip, the
locusts droning, the whir of a young partridge, the
squeak of a chipmunk&mdash;were tuned to the harmony of
the moment and her voice:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Night and the sombre silence, oh, my love, and one
star shining! First, warm, velvety sleep, and then this
quick, quiet waking to your voice which seems to call me.
Is it&mdash;<i>is</i> it you that calls? Do you sometimes, even in
your dreams, speak to me? Far beneath unconsciousness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
is there the summons of your spirit to me?... I like to
think so. I like to think that this thing which has come
to us is deeper, greater than we are. Sometimes day and
night there flash before my eyes&mdash;my mind&#8217;s eyes&mdash;pictures
of you and me in places unfamiliar, landscapes never
before seen, activities uncomprehended and unknown,
bright, alluring glimpses of some second being, some possible,
maybe never-to-be-realized future, alas! Yet these
swift-moving shutters of the soul, or imagination, <i>or</i> reality&mdash;who
shall say which?&mdash;give me a joy never before felt
in life. If I am not a better man for this love of mine for
you, I am <i>more</i> than I was, and shall be more than I am.
Much of my life in the past was mean and small, so much
that I have said and done has been unworthy&mdash;my love
for you is too sharp a light for my gross imperfections of
the past! Come what will, be what must, I stake my life,
my heart, my soul on you&mdash;that beautiful, beloved face;
those deep eyes in which my being is drowned; those lucid,
perfect hands that have bound me to the mast of your
destiny. I cannot go back, I must go forward: now I
must keep on loving you or be shipwrecked. I did not
know that this was in me, this tide of love, this current
of devotion. Destiny plays me beyond my ken, beyond
my dreams. &#8220;<i>O Cith&oelig;ron!</i>&#8221; Turn from me now&mdash;or never,
O my love! Loose me from the mast, and let the storm
and wave wash me out into the sea of your forgetfulness
now&mdash;or never!... But keep me, keep me, if your love is
great enough, if I bring you any light or joy; for I am
yours to my uttermost note of life.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;He knew!&mdash;he knew!&#8221; Rawley said, catching her
wrists in his hands and drawing her to him. &#8220;If I
could write, that&#8217;s what I should have said to you,
beautiful and beloved. How mean and small and ugly
my life was till you made me over! I was a bad lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much hung on one little promise,&#8221; she said, and
drew closer to him. &#8220;You were never bad,&#8221; she added;
then, with an arm sweeping the universe, &#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t it
all good, and isn&#8217;t it all worth living?&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 389px;'>
&#8220;OH, ISN&#8217;T IT ALL WORTH LIVING?&#8221; SHE SAID<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></div>
<p>His face lost its glow. Over in the town her brother
faced a ruined life, and the girl beside him a dark
humiliation and a shame which would poison her life
hereafter, unless&mdash;his look turned to the little house
where the quack-doctor lived. He loosed her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for Caliban,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be Ariel and follow you&mdash;in my heart,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Be sure and make him tell you the story of
his life,&#8221; she added, with a laugh, as his lips swept the
hair behind her ears.</p>
<p>As he moved swiftly away, watching his long strides,
she said, proudly, &#8220;As deep as the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a moment she added: &#8220;And he was once a
gambler, until, until&#8221; she&mdash;glanced at the open book,
then with sweet mockery looked at her hands&mdash;&#8220;until
&#8216;those lucid, perfect hands bound me to the mast of
your destiny.&#8217; O vain Diana! But they are rather
beautiful,&#8221; she added, softly, &#8220;and I am rather happy.&#8221;
There was something like a gay little chuckle in her
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;O vain Diana!&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Rawley entered the door of the hut on the hill without
ceremony. There was no need for courtesy, and the
work he had come to do could be easier done without it.</p>
<p>Old Busby was crouched over a table, his mouth
lapping milk from a full bowl on the table. He scarcely
raised his head when Rawley entered&mdash;through the open
door he had seen his visitor coming. He sipped on, his
straggling beard dripping. There was silence for a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he growled at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finish your swill, and then we can talk,&#8221; said Rawley,
carelessly. He took a chair near the door, lighted a
cheroot and smoked, watching the old man, as he tipped
the great bowl toward his face, as though it were some
wild animal feeding. The clothes were patched and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
worn, the coat-front was spattered with stains of all
kinds, the hair and beard were unkempt and long, giving
him what would have been the look of a mangy lion
but that the face had the expression of some beast less
honorable. The eyes, however, were malignantly intelligent;
the hands, ill-cared for, were long, well-shaped,
and capable, but of a hateful yellow color like the face.
And through all was a sense of power, dark and almost
mediæval. Secret, evilly wise, and inhuman, he looked
a being apart, whom men might seek for help in dark
purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want&mdash;medicine?&#8221; he muttered at
last, wiping his beard and mouth with the palm of his
hand, and the palm on his knees.</p>
<p>Rawley looked at the ominous-looking bottles on the
shelves above the old man&#8217;s head, at the forceps, knives,
and other surgical instruments on the walls&mdash;they at
least were bright and clean&mdash;and, taking the cheroot
slowly from his mouth, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shin-plasters are what I want. A friend of mine has
caught his leg in a trap.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man gave an evil chuckle at the joke, for a
&#8220;shin-plaster&#8221; was a money-note worth a quarter of a
dollar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some,&#8221; he growled in reply, &#8220;but they cost
twenty-five cents each. You can have them for your
friend at the price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want eight thousand of them from you. He&#8217;s hurt
pretty bad,&#8221; was the dogged, dry answer.</p>
<p>The shaggy eyebrows of the quack drew together,
and the eyes peered out sharply through half-closed lids.
&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of wanting and not much getting in
this world,&#8221; he rejoined, with a leer of contempt, and
spat on the floor, while yet the furtive watchfulness of
the eyes indicated a mind ill at ease.</p>
<p>Smoke came in placid puffs from the cheroot&mdash;Rawley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
was smoking very hard, but with a judicial meditation,
as it seemed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but if you want a thing so bad that, to get it,
you&#8217;ll face the devil or the Beast of Revelations, it&#8217;s
likely to come to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You call me a beast?&#8221; The reddish-brown face
grew black like that of a Bedouin in his rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said the Beast of Revelations&mdash;don&#8217;t you know the
Scriptures?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that a fool is to be answered according to
his folly,&#8221; was the hoarse reply, and the great head
wagged to and fro in its smarting rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m doing my best; and perhaps when the folly
is all out we&#8217;ll come to the revelations of the Beast.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence, in which the gross impostor
shifted heavily in his seat, while a hand twitched across
the mouth and then caught at the breast of the threadbare
black coat abstractedly.</p>
<p>Rawley leaned forward, one elbow on a knee, the cheroot
in his fingers. He spoke almost confidentially,
as to some ignorant and misguided savage&mdash;as he had
talked to Indian chiefs in his time when searching for
the truth regarding some crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a lot of revelations in my time. A lawyer
and a doctor always do. And though there are folks
who say I&#8217;m no lawyer, as there are those who say with
greater truth that you&#8217;re no doctor, speaking technically,
we&#8217;ve both had &#8216;revelations.&#8217; You&#8217;ve seen a lot that&#8217;s
seamy, and so have I. You&#8217;re pretty seamy yourself.
In fact, you&#8217;re as bad a man as ever saved lives&mdash;and
lost them. You&#8217;ve had a long tether, and you&#8217;ve
swung on it&mdash;swung wide. But you&#8217;ve had a lot of luck
that you haven&#8217;t swung high, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and flicked away the ash from his cheroot,
while the figure before him swayed animal-like from
side to side, muttering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got brains, a great lot of brains of a kind&mdash;however
you came by them,&#8221; Rawley continued; &#8220;and
you&#8217;ve kept a lot of people in the West from passing
in their checks before their time. You&#8217;ve rooked &#8217;em,
chiselled &#8217;em out of a lot of cash, too. There was old
Lamson&mdash;fifteen hundred for the goitre on his neck;
and Mrs. Gilligan for the cancer&mdash;two thousand, wasn&#8217;t
it? &#8216;Tincture of Lebanon Leaves&#8217; you called the medicine,
didn&#8217;t you? You must have made fifty thousand
or so in the last ten years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ve made I&#8217;ll keep,&#8221; was the guttural answer,
and the talon-like fingers clawed the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made people pay high for curing them, saving
them sometimes; but you haven&#8217;t paid me high for
saving you in the courts; and there&#8217;s one case that you
haven&#8217;t paid me for at all. That was when the patient
died&mdash;and you didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>The face of the old man became mottled with a sudden
fear, but he jerked it forward once or twice with
an effort at self-control. Presently he steadied to the
ordeal of suspense, while he kept saying to himself,
&#8220;What does he know&mdash;what&mdash;which?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Malpractice resulting in death&mdash;that was poor Jimmy
Tearle; and something else resulting in death&mdash;that
was the switchman&#8217;s wife. And the law is hard in the
West where a woman&#8217;s in the case&mdash;quick and hard.
Yes, you&#8217;ve swung wide on your tether; look out that
you don&#8217;t swing high, old man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can prove nothing; it&#8217;s bluff!&#8221; came the reply
in a tone of malice and of fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget. I was your lawyer in Jimmy Tearle&#8217;s
case, and a letter&#8217;s been found written by the switchman&#8217;s
wife to her husband. It reached me the night he
was killed by the avalanche. It was handed over to
me by the post-office, as the lawyer acting for the relatives.
I&#8217;ve read it. I&#8217;ve got it. It gives you away.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t alone.&#8221; Fear had now disappeared, and the
old man was fighting.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you weren&#8217;t alone; and if the switchman and the
switchman&#8217;s wife weren&#8217;t dead and out of it all, and if
the other man that didn&#8217;t matter any more than you
wasn&#8217;t alive and hadn&#8217;t a family that does matter, I
wouldn&#8217;t be asking you peaceably for two thousand
dollars as my fee for getting you off two cases that
might have sent you to prison for twenty years, or,
maybe, hung you to the nearest tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>The heavy body pulled itself together, the hands
clinched. &#8220;Blackmail&mdash;you think I&#8217;ll stand it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think you will. I want two thousand dollars
to help a friend in a hole, and I mean to have it, if you
think your neck&#8217;s worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teeth, wonderfully white, showed through the shaggy
beard. &#8220;If I had to go to prison&mdash;or swing, as you say&mdash;do
you think I&#8217;d go with my mouth shut? I&#8217;d not
pay up alone. The West would crack&mdash;holy Heaven,
I know enough to make it sick. Go on and see! I&#8217;ve
got the West in my hand.&#8221; He opened and shut his
fingers with a grimace of cruelty which shook Rawley in
spite of himself.</p>
<p>Rawley had trusted to the inspiration of the moment;
he had had no clearly defined plan; he had believed
that he could frighten the old man, and by force of will
bend him to his purposes. It had all been more difficult
than he had expected. He kept cool, imperturbable,
and determined, however. He knew that what the old
quack said was true&mdash;the West might shake with scandal
concerning a few who, no doubt, in remorse and secret
fear, had more than paid the penalty of their offences.
But he thought of Di Welldon and of her criminal
brother, and every nerve, every faculty, was screwed
to its utmost limit of endurance and capacity.</p>
<p>Suddenly the old man gave a new turn to the event.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
He got up and, rummaging in an old box, drew out a
dice-box. Rattling the dice, he threw them out on the
table before him, a strange, excited look crossing his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Play for it,&#8221; he said, in a harsh, croaking voice.
&#8220;Play for the two thousand. Win it, if you can. You
want it bad. I want to keep it bad. It&#8217;s nice to have;
it makes a man feel warm&mdash;money does. I&#8217;d sleep in
ten-dollar bills, I&#8217;d have my clothes made of them, if I
could; I&#8217;d have my house papered with them; I&#8217;d eat
&#8217;em. Oh, I know, I know about you&mdash;and her&mdash;Diana
Welldon! You&#8217;ve sworn off gambling, and you&#8217;ve kept
your pledge for near a year. Well, it&#8217;s twenty years
since I gambled&mdash;twenty years. I gambled with these
then.&#8221; He shook the dice in the box. &#8220;I gambled
everything I had away&mdash;more than two thousand dollars&mdash;more
than two thousand dollars.&#8221; He laughed a raw,
mirthless laugh. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re the greatest gambler in
the West. So was I&mdash;in the East. It pulverized me at
last, when I&#8217;d nothing left&mdash;and drink, drink, drink. I
gave up both one night and came out West. I started
doctoring here. I&#8217;ve got money, plenty of money&mdash;medicine,
mines, land got it for me. I&#8217;ve been lucky.
Now you come to bluff me&mdash;me! You don&#8217;t know old
Busby.&#8221; He spat on the floor. &#8220;I&#8217;m not to be bluffed.
I know too much. Before they could lynch me I&#8217;d talk.
But to play you, the greatest gambler in the West,
for two thousand dollars&mdash;yes, I&#8217;d like the sting of
it again. Twos, fours, double-sixes&mdash;the gentleman&#8217;s
game!&#8221; He rattled the dice and threw them with a
flourish out on the table, his evil face lighting up.
&#8220;Come! You can&#8217;t have something for nothing!&#8221; he
growled.</p>
<p>As he spoke, a change came over Rawley&#8217;s face. It
lost its cool imperturbability, it grew paler, the veins on
the fine forehead stood out, a new, flaring light came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
into the eyes. The old gambler&#8217;s spirit was alive. But
even as it rose, sweeping him into that area of fiery
abstraction where every nerve is strung to a fine tension
and the surrounding world disappears, he saw the face
of Diana Welldon, he remembered her words to him not
an hour before, and the issue of the conflict, other considerations
apart, was without doubt. But there was
her brother and his certain fate if the two thousand dollars
were not paid in by midnight. He was desperate.
It was in reality for Diana&#8217;s sake. He approached the
table, and his old calm returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no money to play with,&#8221; he said, quietly.</p>
<p>With a gasp of satisfaction, the old man fumbled in
the inside of his coat and drew out layers of ten, fifty,
and hundred dollar bills. It was lined with them. He
passed a pile over to Rawley&mdash;two thousand dollars.
He placed a similar pile before himself.</p>
<p>As Rawley laid his hand on the bills, the thought
rushed through his mind, &#8220;You have it&mdash;keep it!&#8221;
but he put it away from him. With a gentleman he
might have done it, with this man before him it was
impossible. He must take his chances; and it was the
only chance in which he had hope now, unless he appealed
for humanity&#8217;s sake, for the girl&#8217;s sake, and told the
real truth. It might avail. Well, that would be the
last resort.</p>
<p>&#8220;For small stakes?&#8221; said the grimy quack, in a gloating
voice.</p>
<p>Rawley nodded, and then added: &#8220;We stop at eleven
o&#8217;clock, unless I&#8217;ve lost or won all before that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And stake what&#8217;s left on the last throw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment, in which Rawley
seemed to grow older, and a set look came to his mouth&mdash;a
broken pledge, no matter what the cause, brings
heavy penalties to the honest mind. He shut his eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
for an instant, and, when he opened them, he saw that
his fellow-gambler was watching him with an enigmatical
and furtive smile. Did this Caliban have some
understanding of what was at stake in his heart and
soul?</p>
<p>&#8220;Play!&#8221; Rawley said, sharply, and was himself again.</p>
<p>For hour after hour there was scarce a sound, save
the rattle of the dice and an occasional exclamation
from the old man as he threw a double-six. As dusk
fell, the door had been shut and a lighted lantern was
hung over their heads.</p>
<p>Fortune had fluctuated. Once the old man&#8217;s pile
had diminished to two notes, then the luck had changed
and his pile grew larger; then fell again; but, as the
hands of the clock on the wall above the blue medicine
bottles reached a quarter to eleven, it increased steadily
throw after throw.</p>
<p>Now the player&#8217;s fever was in Rawley&#8217;s eyes. His
face was deadly pale, but his hand threw steadily,
calmly, almost negligently, as it might seem. All at
once, at eight minutes to eleven, the luck turned in his
favor, and his pile mounted again. Time after time
he dropped double-sixes. It was almost uncanny. He
seemed to see the dice in the box, and his hand threw
them out with the precision of a machine. Long afterward
he had this vivid illusion that he could see
the dice in the box. As the clock was about to strike
eleven he had before him three thousand eight hundred
dollars. It was his throw.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred,&#8221; he said, in a whisper, and threw.
He won.</p>
<p>With a gasp of relief, he got to his feet, the money
in his hand. He stepped backward from the table,
then staggered, and a faintness passed over him. He
had sat so long without moving that his legs bent under
him. There was a pail of water with a dipper in it on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
a bench. He caught up a dipperful of water, drank it
empty, and let it fall in the pail again with a clatter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan,&#8221; he said, abstractedly&mdash;&#8220;Dan, you&#8217;re all safe
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he seemed to wake, as from a dream, and
looked at the man at the table. Busby was leaning on
it with both hands, and staring at Rawley like some
animal jaded and beaten from pursuit. Rawley walked
back to the table and laid down two thousand dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wanted two thousand,&#8221; he said, and put the
other two thousand in his pocket.</p>
<p>The evil eyes gloated, the long fingers clutched the
pile and swept it into a great inside pocket. Then the
shaggy head bent forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it was for Dan,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;Dan Welldon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rawley hesitated. &#8220;What is that to you?&#8221; he replied,
at last.</p>
<p>With a sudden impulse the old impostor lurched
round, opened a box, drew out a roll, and threw it on
the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to be known sometime,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you&#8217;ll
be my lawyer when I&#8217;m put into the ground&mdash;you&#8217;re
clever. They call me a quack. Malpractice&mdash;bah!
There&#8217;s my diploma&mdash;James Clifton Welldon. Right
enough, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rawley was petrified. He knew the forgotten story
of James Clifton Welldon, the specialist, turned gambler,
who had almost ruined his own brother&mdash;the father
of Dan and Diana&mdash;at cards and dice, and had then
ruined himself and disappeared. Here, where his brother
had died, he had come years ago and practised medicine
as a quack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s plenty of proof, if it&#8217;s wanted!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it here.&#8221; He tapped the box behind him.
&#8220;Why did I do it? Because it&#8217;s my way. And you&#8217;re
going to marry my niece, and&#8217;ll have it all some day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
But not till I&#8217;ve finished with it&mdash;not unless you win
it from me at dice or cards.... But no&#8221;&mdash;something
human came into the old, degenerate face&mdash;&#8220;no more
gambling for the man that&#8217;s to marry Diana. There&#8217;s
a wonder and a beauty!&#8221; He chuckled to himself.
&#8220;She&#8217;ll be rich when I&#8217;ve done with it. You&#8217;re a lucky
man&mdash;ay, you&#8217;re lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rawley was about to tell the old man what the two
thousand dollars was for, but a fresh wave of repugnance
passed over him, and, hastily drinking another dipperful
of water, he opened the door. He looked back.
The old man was crouching forward, lapping milk from
the great bowl, his beard dripping. In disgust he swung
round again. The fresh, clear air caught his face.</p>
<p>With a gasp of relief he stepped out into the night,
closing the door behind him.</p>
